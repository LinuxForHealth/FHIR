    "description": "Medication Reference Terminology (MED-RT) is the evolutionary successor to the Veterans Health Administration National Drug File – Reference Terminology (VHA NDF-RT). Both are formal ontology representations of medication terminology, pharmacologic classifications, and asserted authoritative relationships between them.\r\n\r\nThe MED-RT code system includes relationships between MED-RT concepts and concepts in external code systems, as well as relationships between concepts only in the external code systems. The external code systems that MED-RT references include RxNorm, MeSH, and SNOMED CT US Edition.\r\n\r\nMED-RT can be downloaded from https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/MED-RT/ \r\n\r\nFor more information, please see https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/pages/vocabulary.jsf?dictionary=MED-RT",
