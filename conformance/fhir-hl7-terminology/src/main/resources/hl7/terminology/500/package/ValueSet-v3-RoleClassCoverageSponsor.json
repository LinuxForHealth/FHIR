Program sponsors may administer the coverage themselves, delegate coverage administration, but not risk to third-party administrators, or contract with health insurance plans to assume the risk and administrator a program. Sponsors qualify individuals who may become\r\n\r\n1.  a policy holder of the plan;\r\n2.  where the sponsor is the policy holder, who may become a subscriber or a dependent to a policy under the plan; or\r\n3.  where the sponsor is a government agency, who may become program eligibles under a program.\r\n\r\nThe sponsor role may be further qualified by the SponsorRole.code. Entities playing the sponsor role may also play the role of a Coverage Administrator.\r\n\r\n*Example:* An employer, union, government agency, or association.",
