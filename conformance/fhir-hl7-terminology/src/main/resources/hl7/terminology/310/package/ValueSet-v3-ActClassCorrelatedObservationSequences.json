    "description": "Container for Observation Sequences (Observations whose values are contained in LIST<>'s) having values correlated with each other. Each contained Observation Sequence LIST<> must be the same length. Values in the LIST<>'s are correlated based on index. E.g. the values in position 2 in all the LIST<>'s are correlated. This is analogous to a table where each column is an Observation Sequence with a LIST<> of values, and each row in the table is a correlation between the columns. For example, a 12-lead ECG would contain 13 sequences: one sequence for time, and a sequence for each of the 12 leads.",
