The sponsor commissions the study, bears the expenses, is responsible for satisfying all legal requirements concerning subject safety and privacy, and is generally responsible for collection, storage and analysis of the data generated during the trial. No scoper is necessary, as a clinical research sponsor undertakes the role on its own authority and declaration.
