In cancer research, hazard ratios are often used in clinical trials to measure survival at any point in time in a group of patients who have been given a specific treatment compared to a control group given another treatment or a placebo. A hazard ratio of one means that there is no difference in survival between the two groups. A hazard ratio of greater than one or less than one means that survival was better in one of the groups.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">C16726<a name=\"statistic-type-C16726\"> </a></td><td>Incidence</td><td>The relative frequency of occurrence of something.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">rate-ratio<a name=\"statistic-type-rate-ratio\"> </a></td><td>Incidence Rate Ratio</td><td>A type of relative effect estimate that compares rates over time (eg events per person-years).</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">C25564<a name=\"statistic-type-C25564\"> </a></td><td>Maximum</td><td>The largest possible quantity or degree.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">C53319<a name=\"statistic-type-C53319\"> </a></td><td>Mean</td><td>The sum of a set of values divided by the number of values in the set.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">0000457<a name=\"statistic-type-0000457\"> </a></td><td>Mean Difference</td><td>The mean difference, or difference in means, measures the absolute difference between the mean value in two different groups.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">C28007<a name=\"statistic-type-C28007\"> </a></td><td>Median</td><td>The value which has an equal number of values greater and less than it.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">C25570<a name=\"statistic-type-C25570\"> </a></td><td>Minimum</td><td>The smallest possible quantity.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">C16932<a name=\"statistic-type-C16932\"> </a></td><td>Odds Ratio</td><td>The ratio of the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group, or to a sample-based estimate of that ratio.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">C65172<a name=\"statistic-type-C65172\"> </a></td><td>Pearson Correlation Coefficient</td><td>A measure of the correlation of two variables X and Y measured on the same object or organism, that is, a measure of the tendency of the variables to increase or decrease together.

In cancer research, risk ratios are used in prospective (forward looking) studies, such as cohort studies and clinical trials. A risk ratio of one means there is no difference between two groups in terms of their risk of cancer, based on whether or not they were exposed to a certain substance or factor, or how they responded to two treatments being compared. A risk ratio of greater than one or of less than one usually means that being exposed to a certain substance or factor either increases (risk ratio greater than one) or decreases (risk ratio less than one) the risk of cancer, or that the treatments being compared do not have the same effects.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">0000424<a name=\"statistic-type-0000424\"> </a></td><td>Risk Difference</td><td>Difference between the observed risks (proportions of individuals with the outcome of interest) in the two groups.
