	"description": "The **$member-match** operation allows one health plan to retrieve a unique identifier for a member from another health plan using a member's demographic and coverage information.  This identifier can then be used to perform subsequent queries and operations. Members implementing a deterministic match will require a match on member id or subscriber id at a minimum.  (I.e. A pure demographic match will not be supported by such implementations.)",
