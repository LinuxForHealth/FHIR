    "description": "The Value Set is a combination of values from volume 1 and volume 2 from the Code System International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and values in the Code System International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)\n\nThe International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) is based on the World Health Organization’s Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). ICD-9-CM was the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States. \n\nThe ICD-9-CM consists of:\n\n*   a tabular list containing a numerical list of the disease code numbers in tabular form;\n*   an alphabetical index to the disease entries; and\n*   a classification system for surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures (alphabetic index and tabular list).\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/) are the U.S. governmental agencies responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to the ICD-9-CM.\n\n[ICD-10-CM](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453674) is the replacement for ICD-9-CM, volumes 1 and 2, effective October 1, 2015.\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the Federal agency responsible for use of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) in the United States, has developed a clinical modification of the classification for morbidity purposes. The ICD-10 is used to code and classify mortality data from death certificates, having replaced ICD-9 for this purpose as of January 1, 1999.\n\nThe clinical modification represents a significant improvement over ICD-9-CM and ICD-10. Specific improvements include: the addition of information relevant to ambulatory and managed care encounters; expanded injury codes; the creation of combination diagnosis/symptom codes to reduce the number of codes needed to fully describe a condition; the addition of sixth and seventh characters; incorporation of common 4th and 5th digit subclassifications; laterality; and greater specificity in code assignment. The new structure will allow further expansion than was possible with ICD-9-CM.\n\nCurrent and previous releases of ICD-9-CM are available here: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm)\n\nCurrent and previous releases of ICD-10-CM are available in PDF and XML format here: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm)\n\nMost files are provided in compressed zip format for ease in downloading. These files have been created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), under authorization by the World Health Organization.
