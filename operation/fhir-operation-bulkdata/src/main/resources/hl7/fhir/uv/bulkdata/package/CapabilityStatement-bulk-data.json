Export data from a FHIR server whether or not it is associated with a patient. This supports use cases like backing up a server or exporting terminology data by restricting the resources returned using the _type parameter.\n1. Obtain data on all patients listed in a single FHIR Group Resource. If a FHIR server supports Group-level data export, it SHOULD support reading and searching for Group resource. This enables clients to discover available groups based on stable characteristics such as Group.identifier. Note: How these groups are defined is implementation specific for each FHIR system. For example, a payer may send a healthcare institution a roster file that can be imported into their EHR to create or update a FHIR group. Group membership could be based upon explicit attributes of the patient, such as: age, sex or a particular condition such as PTSD or Chronic Opioid use, or on more complex attributes, such as a recent inpatient discharge or membership in the population used to calculate a quality measure. FHIR-based group management is out of scope for the current version of this implementation guide.\n1. Export data from a FHIR server for all data associated with patients. This supports use cases like transmitting all data about patients or clinical care between systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>System History</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>System Search</td><td></td></tr></table><table><tr><th><b>Resource Type</b></th><th><b>Profile</b></th><th><b title=\"GET a resource (read interaction)\">Read</b></th><th><b title=\"GET all set of resources of the type (search interaction)\">Search</b></th><th><b title=\"PUT a new resource version (update interaction)\">Update</b></th><th><b title=\"POST a new resource (create interaction)\">Create</b></th></tr><tr><td>group</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>patient</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></div>"},"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/CapabilityStatement/bulk-data","version":"1.0.1","name":"BulkDataIGCapabilityStatement","title":"FHIR Bulk Data Export (Flat FHIR) Implementation Guide CapabilityStatement","status":"active","experimental":false,"date":"2020-07-02","publisher":"SMART Health IT","contact":[{"name":"Ricky Sahu","telecom":[{"system":"email","value":"ricky@1up.health"}]},{"name":"Dan Gottlieb","telecom":[{"system":"email","value":"daniel.gottlieb@childrens.harvard.edu"}]},{"name":"Josh Mandel","telecom":[{"system":"email","value":"joshua.mandel@childrens.harvard.edu"}]},{"name":"Vlad Ignatov","telecom":[{"system":"email","value":"Vladimir.Ignatov@childrens.harvard.edu"}]}],"description":"This Section describes the expected capabilities of a FHIR Bulk Data Server actor which is responsible for providing responses to the queries submitted by the FHIR Bulk Data Requestors.
