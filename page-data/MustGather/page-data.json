The logs are stored in a folder in the current working directory.\n\nTo gather diagnostic logs, run the following commands as Cluster Administrator and replace `YOUR_NAMESPACE` with your namespace that the IBM FHIR Server and the IBM FHIR Server Schematool is running.\n\n1. Log in to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a cluster administrator by using the oc CLI.\n\n1. Provide the output of the OpenShift version.\n\n```\noc version > version.txt\n```\n\n1. Provide the output of the Kubectl version.\n\n```\nkubectl version >> version.txt\n```\n\n1. Collection information about the nodes.\n\n```\noc get nodes -o wide -n YOUR_NAMESPACE > nodes.txt\n```\n\n1.

Collect information about the pod containers\n\n```\noc get pods -o jsonpath=\"{..image}\"  -n YOUR_NAMESPACE > containerInfo.txt\n```\n\n1.

The oc adm must-gather CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, such as:\n\n```\noc adm must-gather\n```\n\n1.
