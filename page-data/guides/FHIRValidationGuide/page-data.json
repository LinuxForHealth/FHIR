If the invariant evaluates to `false` then the FHIR validator will generate an OperationOutcome.Issue with the severity set relative to the \"level\" of the constraint (i.e. \"Rule\" or \"Warning\");\n\n![https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/images/fhir-dependency-graph.png](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/images/fhir-dependency-graph.png)\n\n## Profile Support\n\nThe validation component will also validate a resource against profiles that it asserts conformance to in the `Resource.meta.profile` element assuming those profiles are available to the IBM FHIR Server via the FHIR registry component ([fhir-registry](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-registry)) at runtime.\n\nGiven a FHIR profile (structure definition) that contains a Snapshot as input, the IBM FHIR Server Profile component ([fhir-profile](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-profile)) generates FHIRPath expressions for a number of different types of constraints. The current scope of constraint generation is:\n\n- Cardinality constraints (required and prohibited elements)\n- Fixed value constraints (Code and Uri data types)\n- Pattern value constraints (CodeableConcept and Identifier data types)\n- Reference type constraints (FHIRPath resolve/is/conformsTo functions)\n- Extension constraints (FHIRPath `conformsTo` function)\n- Vocabulary constraints (FHIRPath `memberOf` function)\n- Choice type constraints (FHIRPath `as` function)\n\nNOTE: there is currently no support for `closed` or `ordered` slices.\n\nFor example, the HL7 bodyweight profile has the following cardinality and fixed value constraints (some details removed for brevity):\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": \"Observation.code.coding:BodyWeightCode.system\",\n    \"path\": \"Observation.code.coding.system\",\n    \"min\": 1,\n    \"max\": \"1\",\n    \"type\": [{\n        \"code\": \"uri\"\n    }],\n    \"fixedUri\": \"http://loinc.org\"\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": \"Observation.code.coding:BodyWeightCode.code\",\n    \"path\": \"Observation.code.coding.code\",\n    \"min\": 1,\n    \"max\": \"1\",\n    \"type\": [{\n        \"code\": \"code\"\n    }],\n    \"fixedCode\": \"29463-7\",\n}\n```\nwhich are used by the ConstraintGenerator to generate the following FHIRPath expression:\n\n```\ncode.where(coding.where(system = 'http://loinc.org' and code = '29463-7').exists()).exists()\n```\n\nThe HL7 bodyweight profile has the following reference type constraint (some details removed for brevity):\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": \"Observation.subject\",\n    \"path\": \"Observation.subject\",\n    \"type\": [{\n        \"code\": \"Reference\",\n        \"targetProfile\": [\n            \"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient\"\n        ]\n    }]      \n}\n```\nwhich is used by the ConstraintGenerator to generate the following FHIRPath expression:\n\n```\nsubject.resolve().is(Patient)\n```\n\nComplex reference types are also supported, for example:\n\n```\nderivedFrom.exists() implies (derivedFrom.all(resolve().is(DocumentReference) or resolve().is(ImagingStudy) or resolve().is(Media) or resolve().is(QuestionnaireResponse) or resolve().is(MolecularSequence) or resolve().conformsTo('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/vitalsigns')))\n```\nis generated from the element definition `Observation.derivedFrom` in the same bodyweight profile.\n\nFHIRPath based constraints specified in `StructureDefinition.snapshot.element.constraint` elements, will also be evaluated during profile validation. All of the constraints generated for a given profile are cached in memory so that they can be reused to validate multiple resources that are asserting conformance to the same profile.\n\n### Making profiles available to the FHIR registry component (FHIRRegistry)\n\nThe FHIR registry component keeps track of definitional resource types (e.g. StructureDefinition, ValueSet, CodeSystem, etc.). It uses the Java ServiceLoader to look for implementations of the FHIRRegistryResourceProvider interface:\n\n```java\npublic interface FHIRRegistryResourceProvider {\n    /**\n     * Get the registry resource from this provider for the given resource type, url and version\n     *\n     * <p>If the version is null, then the latest version of the registry resource is returned (if available)\n     *\n     * @param resourceType\n     *     the resource type of the registry resource\n     * @param url\n     *     the url of the registry resource\n     * @param version\n     *     the version of the registry resource (optional)\n     * @return\n     *     the registry resource from this provider for the given resource type, url and version if exists, null otherwise\n     */\n    FHIRRegistryResource getRegistryResource(Class<? extends Resource> resourceType, String url, String version);\n\n    /**\n     * Get the registry resources from this provider for the given resource type\n     *\n     * @param resourceType\n     *     the resource type of the registry resource\n     * @return\n     *     the registry resources from this provider for the given resource type\n     */\n    Collection<FHIRRegistryResource> getRegistryResources(Class<? extends Resource> resourceType);\n\n    /**\n     * Get all the registry resources from this provider\n     *\n     * @return\n     *     all of the registry resources from this provider\n     */\n    Collection<FHIRRegistryResource> getRegistryResources();\n\n    /**\n     * Get the profile resources from this provider that constrain the given resource type\n     *\n     * @param type\n     *     the constrained resource type\n     * @return\n     *     the profile resources from this provider that constrain the given resource type\n     */\n    Collection<FHIRRegistryResource> getProfileResources(String type);\n\n\n    /**\n     * Get the search parameter resources from this provider with the given search parameter type\n     * (e.g. string, token, etc.)\n     *\n     * @param type\n     *     the search parameter type\n     * @return\n     *     the search parameter resources from this provider with the given search parameter type\n     */\n    Collection<FHIRRegistryResource> getSearchParameterResources(String type);\n}\n```\n\nPackage your implementation in a jar file and be sure to include its fully-qualified classname in your jar's\n`META-INF/services/com.ibm.fhir.registry.spi.FHIRRegistryResourceProvider`, then drop this jar in the server's userlib directory to make it available to the server during startup.\n\n### NPM package format support\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server Registry module ([fhir-registry](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-registry)) has utilities that can be used to expose FHIR registry resources that exist in the NPM package format. Implementation guides that follow this packaging format can be dropped into the `src/main/resources/` under a directory structure defined by the ImplementationGuide.packageId value. For example, US Core implementation guide has a package id of: `hl7.fhir.us.core`. The NPM \"package\" folder can be dropped here: `src/main/resources/hl7/fhir/us/core/package`\n\n![https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/images/us-core-package.png](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/images/us-core-package.png)\n\n\nFor convenience, we have created a base implementation of `FHIRRegistryResourceProvider` called `PackageRegistryResourceProvider`. The implementation of the `USCoreResourceProvider` using this implementation looks like this:\n\n```java\npublic class USCoreResourceProvider extends PackageRegistryResourceProvider {\n    @Override\n    public String getPackageId() {\n        return \"hl7.fhir.us.core\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `PackgageRegistryResourceProvider` class converts the packageId (e.g. hl7.fhir.us.core) to a path where it can find the NPM package index file: `.index.json`. The `PackageRegistryResourceProvider` class creates `FHIRRegistryResource` instances, using the index file, and caches them in a map on startup. The `PackageRegistryResource` (an implementation of `FHIRRegistryResource` class lazily loads the underlying FHIR resource into memory when it is accessed. Multiple versions of the same resource can be registered. FHIR registry resource providers can be bundled into a jar file and deployed with the IBM FHIR server in the user lib directory.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server uses the Snapshot and not the Differential, you must include a Snapshot. As mentioned in [#2829](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/issues/2829), you may use FHIR Sushi with the `-s` option to generate a Snapshot.\n\nFor more information, please see: [https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/NPM+Package+Specification](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/NPM+Package+Specification)\n\n### Built-in profile support\n\nThe IBM FHIR server has built-in support for the following:\n\n- Profiles defined in the base FHIR Specification (v4.0.1: R4 - Mixed Normative and STU) [http://hl7.org/fhir/profilelist.html](http://hl7.org/fhir/profilelist.html)\n\n### Optional profile support\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server project includes modules for select FHIR implementation guides and makes versions of those available in both Maven Central and in the fhir-validation-distribution.zip artifact, which may be downloaded from [https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/releases](releases). To make an implemenation guide available to the server, copy the corresponding jar (e.g. `fhir-ig-us-core-VERSION.jar`) to the IBM FHIR Server's userlib directory before startup.\n\nIn many cases, these modules wrap multiple versions of the corresponding implementation guide.\nBy default, the server will use the latest version of given resource for validation purposes.\nSee [Section 4.5.3 of the User's Guide](#453-profile-validation) for related configuration options.\n\nBelow is the list of implementation guides that are packaged as part of the project and which implementation guide versions they include:\n\n|Implementation Guide|Packaged Versions|\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n|US Core|`3.1.1`, `4.0.0`, `5.0.1`|\n|CARIN Consumer Directed Payer Data Exchange (CARIN IG for BlueButton®)|`1.0.0`, `1.1.0`|\n|minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)|`1.0.0`\n|Da Vinci Health Record Exchange (HREX)|`1.0.0`|\n|Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDEX)|`1.0.0`, `2.0.0`|\n|Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDEX) Plan Net|`1.0.0`, `1.1.0`|\n|Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) US Drug Formulary|`1.0.1`, `1.1.0`|\n\n## The IBM FHIR Server $validate operation\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server provides a basic implementation of the $validate operation that invokes the FHIRValidator via a REST API. By default, the $validate operation will validate a resource against the base specification and any profiles asserted in its `Resource.meta.profile` element. The default behavior may be changed in one of the following ways:\n\n- If a profile is specified via the optional `profile` parameter, the $validate operation will validate a resource against the base specification and the specified profile only. It will not validate against any profiles asserted in the `Resource.meta.profile` element.\n- If the `profile` parameter is not specified, but the `mode` parameter is specified, and the `mode` parameter value is either `create` or `update`, the $validate operation will validate a resource against the base specification and any profiles asserted in its `Resource.meta.profile` element, but will do so based on profile configuration properties specified in the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles` section of the `fhir-server-config.json` file (see the [user guide](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide#51-configuration-properties-reference) for configuration details).\n\n## ValueSet membership checking (FHIRPath `memberOf` function)\n\nCoded elements (code, Coding, CodeableConcept data types), maybe have a binding element that specifies a ValueSet that that element is bound to. This means that the coded element must have a value that comes from that value set. The FHIR profile component will expand value sets according to the ValueSet [expansion algorithm](http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset.html#expansion) for ValueSets that include CodeSystem resources available via the FHIR registry component.\n\n\n## fhir-path-cli - command line execution of fhirpath over a FHIR Resource\n\nThe fhir-path-cli enables commandline processing of a FHIR Path over a FHIR resource and outputs the results.\n\nFor details on the fhir-path-cli, refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-path/README.md)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6261ac384693a6459167f380169d47eb","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":119,"fieldOwners":{"slug":"gatsby-plugin-slug"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"FHIR Validation Guide","layout":"post","description":"FHIR Validation Guide","date":"2021-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","permalink":"/FHIRValidationGuide/"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: FHIR Validation Guide\ndescription: FHIR Validation Guide\ndate:   2021-10-29\npermalink: /FHIRValidationGuide/\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server validation module ([fhir-validation](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-validation)) provides Java APIs for validating FHIR resources using constraints specified in their corresponding structure definitions.\n\nThe validation module is available from our [Maven artifact repository](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/fhir#building-on-top-of-the-ibm-fhir-server-modules) and is also packaged together with its dependencies and all of our pre-packaged implementation guides in the `fhir-validation-distribution.zip` artifact which may be downloaded from [https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/releases](releases).\n\n## How it works\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server validation module evaluates constraints from both the core specification and from structure definitions that are available at runtime.\nFor example, in the Patient resource, we have the following constraint:\n\n```java\n@Constraint(\n    id = \"pat-1\",\n    level = \"Rule\",\n    location = \"Patient.contact\",\n    description = \"SHALL at least contain a contact's details or a reference to an organization\",\n    expression = \"name.exists() or telecom.exists() or address.exists() or organization.exists()\"\n)\n```\n\nThe validation component picks up the Java annotation, pulls out the FHIRPath expression and passes it on to the IBM FHIR Server FHIRPath component ([fhir-path](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-path)) for evaluation.

The FHIR profile component will expand value sets according to the ValueSet [expansion algorithm](http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset.html#expansion) for ValueSets that include CodeSystem resources available via the FHIR registry component.\n\n\n## fhir-path-cli - command line execution of fhirpath over a FHIR Resource\n\nThe fhir-path-cli enables commandline processing of a FHIR Path over a FHIR resource and outputs the results.\n\nFor details on the fhir-path-cli, refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-path/README.md)\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/FHIR/FHIR/fhir/docs/src/pages/guides/FHIRValidationGuide.md","fields":{"slug":"/guides/FHIRValidationGuide"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","227138135","227138135","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3906363820","3906363820","768070550"]}
