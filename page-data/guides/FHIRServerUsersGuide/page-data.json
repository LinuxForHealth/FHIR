Prereqs: The IBM FHIR Server requires Java 11 and has been tested with OpenJDK 11. To install Java on your system, we recommend downloading and installing OpenJDK 11 from https://adoptium.net/.\n\n1.  To install the IBM FHIR Server, build or download the `fhir-install` zip installer.\nThe Maven build creates the zip package under `fhir-install/target`. Alternatively, releases are available from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/fhir/releases).\n\n2.  Unzip the `.zip` package into a clean directory (referred to as `fhir-installer` here):\n    ```\n        mkdir fhir-installer\n        cd fhir-installer\n        unzip fhir-server-distribution.zip\n    ```\n\n3.  Determine an install location for the OpenLiberty server and the IBM FHIR Server webapp. Example:  `/opt/ibm/fhir-server`\n\n4.  Run the `install.sh/.bat` script to install the server:\n    ```\n        ./fhir-server-dist/install.sh /opt/ibm/fhir-server\n    ```\n    This step installs the OpenLiberty runtime and the IBM FHIR Server web application. The Liberty runtime is installed in a directory called `wlp` within the installation directory that you specify. For example, in the preceding command, the root directory of the Liberty server runtime would be `/opt/ibm/fhir-server/wlp`.\n\n5.  Configure the fhir-server's `server.xml` file as needed by completing the following steps:\n    * Configure the ports that the server listen on. The server is installed with only port 9443 (HTTPS) enabled by default. To change the port numbers, modify the values in the `httpEndpoint` element.\n    * Configure a server keystore and truststore. The IBM FHIR Server is installed with a default keystore file that contains a single self-signed certificate for localhost. For production use, you must create and configure your own keystore and truststore files for the FHIR server deployment (that is, generate your own server certificate or obtain a trusted certificate, and then share the public key certificate with API consumers so that they can insert it into their client-side truststore). The keystore and truststore files are used along with the server's HTTPS endpoint and the FHIR server's client-certificate-based authentication protocol to secure the FHIR server's endpoint. For more information, see [Section 5.2 Keystores, truststores, and the FHIR server](#52-keystores-truststores-and-the-fhir-server).\n    * Configure an appropriate user registry. The FHIR server is installed with a basic user registry that contains a single user named `fhiruser`. For production use, it's best to configure your own user registry. For more information about configuring user registries, see the [OpenLiberty documentation](https://openliberty.io/guides/security-intro.html#configuring-the-user-registry).\n\n    To override the default fhiruser's password, one may set an Environment variable `FHIR_USER_PASSWORD` and for the fhiradmin's password one may set an Environment variable `FHIR_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.\n\n6.  Make sure that your selected database product is running and ready to accept requests as needed:\n    * By default, the FHIR server is installed with the JDBC persistence layer configured to use an Embedded Derby database. When using the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, set the `BOOTSTRAP_DB` environment variable to `true` in order to bootstrap this database. For any other configuration, note the database host and port and, if necessary, create a user with privileges for deploying the schema.\n\n7.  Create and deploy the IBM FHIR Server database schema as needed:\n    * By default, the FHIR server is installed with the JDBC persistence layer configured to use an Embedded Derby database. When using the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, set the `BOOTSTRAP_DB` environment variable to `true` in order to bootstrap this database. For any other configuration, use the `fhir-persistence-schema` module to create and deploy the database schema.\n    * The Db2 persistence layer is always tenant-aware, so you must provision a tenant in addition to deploying the schema. Note the tenant name you provisioned and the tenantKey generated by `fhir-persistence-schema` for the next step.\n\n8.  Configure the `fhir-server-config.json`<sup id=\"a1\">[1](#f1)</sup> configuration file as needed:\n    * By default, the FHIR server is installed with the JDBC persistence layer configured to use a single-tenant Embedded Derby database. For more information, see [Section 3.3 Persistence layer configuration](#33-persistence-layer-configuration).\n\n9.  To start and stop the server, use the Liberty server command:\n```\n    <WLP_HOME>/bin/server start fhir-server\n    <WLP_HOME>/bin/server stop fhir-server\n```\n\n9.  After you start the server, you can verify that it's running properly by invoking the `$healthcheck` endpoint like this:\n\n```\n    curl -k -u '<username>:<password>' 'https://<host>:<port>/fhir-server/api/v4/$healthcheck'\n```\n\nwhere `<username>` is one of the users configured in `server.xml` (default is `fhiruser`).  \nUse single quotes around the URL to prevent $healthcheck from being evaluated as an environment variable on unix-based operating systems.  \n\nOne should see an empty body in the response with a HTTP Response Code 200.\n\nFor more information about the capabilities of the implementation, see [Conformance](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/Conformance).\n\n## 2.2 Upgrading an existing server\nThe IBM FHIR Server does not include an upgrade installer. To upgrade a server to the next version, install the new version to a separate location and copy the configuration files from your existing installation (reconciling any configuration-related changes from the new release in the process).\n\nTo manage database updates over time, the IBM FHIR Server uses custom tools from the `fhir-database-utils` project. Through the use of a metadata table, the database utilities can detect the currently installed version of the database schema and apply any new changes that are needed to bring the database to the current level.\n\nComplete the following steps to upgrade the server:\n\n1. Run the fhir-installer on a separate server.\n2. Configure the new server as appropriate (`fhir-server/server.xml` and anything under the `fhir-server/configDropins`, `fhir-server/config`, and `fhir-server/userlib` directories).\n3. Back up your database.  \n4. Run the migration program (see [Section 3.3.1.1 Supported databases](#3311-supported-databases)).  \n5. Disable traffic to the old server and enable traffic to the new server.\n\n## 2.3 Docker\nThe IBM FHIR Server includes a Docker image [ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server).\n\nNote, logging for the IBM FHIR Server docker image is to stderr and stdout, and is picked up by Logging agents.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server is configured using Environment variables using:\n\n| Environment Variable | Description |\n|----------------------|-------------|\n|`DISABLED_OPERATIONS`|A comma-separated list of operations which are disabled on the IBM FHIR Server, for example, `validate,import`. Note, do not include the dollar sign `$`|\n\n*Development-Only*: If you are using the IBM FHIR Server on a development machine with under 3.25G of RAM. You should download [jvm-dev.options](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/blob/main/fhir-server-webapp/src/main/liberty/config/configDropins/disabled/jvm-dev.options) and mount it when starting the Docker container.  You can use the following pattern for starting up in a restricted test environment (or build your own layer).\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 9443:9443 -e BOOTSTRAP_DB=true \\\n  -v $(pwd)/jvm-dev.options:/config/configDropins/default/jvm.options \\\n  ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server\n```\n\n# 3 Configuration\nThis chapter contains information about the various ways in which the IBM FHIR Server can be configured by users.\n\n## 3.1 Liberty server configuration\nThe IBM FHIR Server is built on the open source [OpenLiberty project](https://openliberty.io/) but also works on the commercial [IBM WebSphere Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty). In documentation and elsewhere, we use `Liberty` to refer to either/or.\n\nAs a Liberty application, the IBM FHIR Server is configurable like any other Liberty server. See https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/server-configuration-overview.html for more information.\n\nBy default, we include:\n* `server.xml` with core server details like the Liberty features, HTTP properties, application info, and a default user registry\n* `jvm.options` with TLS and heap size settings\n* `server.env` with timezone set to UTC\n* `configDropins` with server.xml dropins sorted into `disabled`, `defaults`, and `overrides`\n\n## 3.1.1 Encoded passwords\nIn the examples within the following sections, you'll see the default password `change-password`. In order to secure your server, these values should be changed.\n\nFor example, the basic user registry in the default server.xml defines users `fhiruser` and `fhiradmin` and variables FHIR_USER_PASSWORD and FHIR_ADMIN_PASSWORD, each with a default value of `change-password`.\n\nThese variables can be changed by setting environment variables by the same name.\nAlternatively, users can change the server.xml or use Liberty configDropins to change the values.\n\nOptionally, server.xml values can be encoded via the Liberty `securityUtility` command. For example, to encode a string value with the default `{xor}` encoding, run the following command:\n\n``` sh\n<WLP_HOME>/bin/securityUtility encode stringToEncode\n```\n\nThe output of this command can then be copied and pasted into your `server.xml` or `fhir-server-config.json` file as needed. The `fhir-server-config.json` does not support the securityUtility's `{aes}` encoding at this time, but per the limits to protection through password encryption<sup>[a]</sup>, this encoding does not provide significant additional security beyond `exclusive or` (XOR) encoding.\n\n## 3.1.2 Logging and trace\nThe default server.xml includes variables for configuring the log output:\n```\n    <variable name=\"TRACE_SPEC\" defaultValue=\"*=info\"/>\n    <variable name=\"TRACE_FILE\" defaultValue=\"trace.log\"/>\n    <variable name=\"TRACE_FORMAT\" defaultValue=\"BASIC\"/>\n```\n\nBy default, INFO level messages will go to both the console and a log file at `wlp/usr/servers/fhir-server/logs/messages.log`. For the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, the default is changed to go just to the console.\n\nTo enable tracing, set the TRACE_SPEC variable (e.g. by setting an environment variable by the same name) to a `:`-delimited list of `component = level` pair values. For example, to turn on tracing for the SQL generated by `fhir-persistence-jdbc`, set the TRACE_SPEC to `com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.dao.impl.*=fine:com.ibm.fhir.database.utils.query.QueryUtil=fine`.\n\nBy default, that trace output appears alongside the `messages.log` file in a file named `trace.log`, but the trace output can be sent to the console instead by setting the `TRACE_FILE` variable to `stdout`.\n\nFor more information on logging and tracing in Liberty, see https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/log-trace-configuration.html.\n\n## 3.2 FHIR server configuration\n\n### 3.2.1 Property names\nConfiguration properties stored within a `fhir-server-config.json` file are structured in a hierarchical manner. Here is an example:\n\n```\n    {\n        \"fhirServer\":{\n            \"core\":{\n                \"defaultPrettyPrint\":false\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThroughout this document, we use a path notation to refer to property names. For example, the name of the `defaultPrettyPrint` property in the preceding example would be `fhirServer/core/defaultPrettyPrint`.\n\n### 3.2.2 Tenant-specific configuration properties\nThe IBM FHIR server supports certain multi-tenant features. One such feature is the ability to set certain configuration properties on a per-tenant basis.\n\nIn general, the configuration properties for a particular tenant are stored in the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/<tenant-id>/fhir-server-config.json` file, where `<tenant-id>` refers to the tenant's “short name” or tenant id.\n\nThe global configuration is considered to be associated with a tenant named `default`, so those properties are stored in the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/default/fhir-server-config.json` file.\n\nSimilarly, tenant-specific search parameters are found at `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/<tenant-id>/extension-search-parameters.json`, whereas the global/default extension search parameters are at `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/default/extension-search-parameters.json`.\n\nSearch parameters are handled like a single configuration properly; providing a tenant-specific file will override the global/default extension search parameters as defined at [FHIRSearchConfiguration](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRSearchConfiguration).\n\nMore information about multi-tenant support can be found in [Section 4.9 Multi-tenancy](#49-multi-tenancy).\n\n## 3.3 Persistence layer configuration\nThe IBM FHIR Server allows deployers to select a persistence layer implementation that fits their needs. Currently, the server includes a JDBC persistence layer which supports Apache Derby, IBM Db2, and PostgreSQL.  However, Apache Derby is not recommended for production usage.\n\nBefore you can configure the server to use the JDBC persistence layer implementation, you first need to prepare the database. This step depends on the database product in use and is covered in more detail in [Section 3.3.1.1 Supported databases](#3311-supported-databases).\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server is delivered with a default configuration that is already configured to use the JDBC persistence layer implementation with an Embedded Derby database. This provides the easiest out-of-the-box experience since it requires very little setup.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server persistence configuration is split between `fhir-server-config.json` and the Liberty `server.xml` and `configDropins`.\n\nWithin `fhir-server-config.json`, the value of the `fhirServer/persistence/factoryClassname` is used to instantiate a FHIRPersistence object. By default, the server is configured to use the FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory:\n\n``` json\n    {\n        \"fhirServer\": {\n            …\n            \"persistence\": {\n                \"factoryClassname\": \"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n                …\n            }\n    }\n```\n\n### 3.3.1 The JDBC persistence layer\nWhen the FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory is in use, the `fhirServer/persistence/datasources` property must specify a mapping from datastore-id values to Liberty datasource definitions. For example, here is the configuration for a datastore with id `default` that is configured for the `jdbc/fhir_default_default` datasource of type `postgresql`:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"factoryClassname\":\"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n            \"datasources\": {\n                \"default\": {\n                    \"type\": \"postgresql\",\n                    \"currentSchema\": \"fhirdata\",\n                    \"jndiName\": \"jdbc/fhir_default_default\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBoth the `type` and the `currentSchema` properties are required.\nThe `type` value must be set to one of the supported JDBC types (currently `db2`, `postgresql`, or `derby`) and it must match the actual database type referenced by the datasource definition. If the type does not match, the behavior is undefined.\nBecause the IBM FHIR Server does not quote the schema name in our generated queries, the `currentSchema` property is effectively case-insensitive.\n\nThe `jndiName` property is optional; it will default to `jdbc/fhir_<tenantId>_<dsId>` where `<tenantId>` and `<dsId>` represent the tenant and datastore ids respectively<sup id=\"a4\">[4](#f4)</sup>.\n\nThe datasource definitions themselves are configured in accordance with the [Liberty documentation on Relational database connections with JDBC](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/relational-database-connections-JDBC.html). Previous versions of the IBM FHIR Server supported a proxy datasource that allowed for datasource definitions in the fhir-server-config.json, but now Liberty JDBC datasource configuration is used due to benefits related to configuring pool sizes, transaction recovery, and monitoring.\n\nFor example, the fhir-server-config snippet from above would have a corresponding Liberty config like this:\n```xml\n<server>\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- TENANT: default; DSID: default; TYPE: read-write               -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_default_default\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibPostgres\"/>\n        <properties.postgresql\n             serverName=\"postgres_postgres_1\"\n             portNumber=\"5432\"\n             databaseName=\"fhirdb\"\n             user=\"fhirserver\"\n             password=\"change-password\"\n             currentSchema=\"fhirdata\"\n         />\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"200\" minPoolSize=\"20\"\n            connectionTimeout=\"60s\" maxIdleTime=\"2m\"\n            numConnectionsPerThreadLocal=\"0\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n</server>\n```\n\nDatasource elements should not be defined in the main `server.xml` file but instead should be defined in the `configDropins/overrides` directory. See the [Liberty Profile Server configuration guide](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/server-configuration-overview.html) for more details and general guidance on creating modular configurations.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server is packaged with the following sample datasource definitions at `configDropins/disabled`:\n* datasource-postgresql.xml\n* datasource-db2.xml\n* datasource-derby.xml\n\nThere are 3 libraries defined in the main `server.xml` that reference the required client drivers for each database type:\n* sharedLibDerby\n* sharedLibDb2\n* sharedLibPostgres\n\nWhen a datasource definition is included in a configDropin under `configDropins/overrides`, this file is picked up when the server starts as indicated by the following AUDIT message:\n\n```\n[AUDIT   ] CWWKG0093A: Processing configuration drop-ins resource: <WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/configDropins/overrides/datasource.xml\n```\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server will look up the tenant and datastore id for each request and use the corresponding JNDI name to obtain a connection for the corresponding datasource.\n\n#### 3.3.1.1 Supported databases\n##### Embedded Derby (default)\nIf you are using the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, you can ask the entrypoint script to create (bootstrap) the database and the schema during startup by setting the `BOOTSTRAP_DB` environment variable to `true`.\n\nThis database bootstrap step is only supported for Embedded Derby and will only bootstrap the default datastore of the default tenant (the default for requests with no tenant or datastore headers).\n\n*Reminder*: the Embedded Derby support is designed to support simple getting started scenarios and is not recommended for production use.\n\n``` xml\n<server>\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- This datasource aligns with the Apache Derby database that is  -->\n    <!-- created by the IBM FHIR Server's DB_BOOTSTRAP process.         -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_default_default\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedXADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibDerby\"/>\n        <properties.derby.embedded createDatabase=\"create\" databaseName=\"derby/fhirDB\"/>\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"50\" minPoolSize=\"10\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n</server>\n```\n\n##### Db2\nIf you configure the FHIR server to use an IBM Db2 database, you must:\n\n1. Create the database if it doesn't already exist.\n\n2. Execute the `fhir-persistence-schema` utility to create the necessary schemas (tables, indices, stored procedures, etc) and tenants.\n\n3. Configure the IBM FHIR Server with the tenantKey generated in step number 2.\n\nAn executable `fhir-persistence-schema` jar can be downloaded from the project's [Releases tab](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/releases) and documentation can be found at https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-persistence-schema.\n\nFor a detailed guide on configuring IBM Db2 on Cloud for the IBM FHIR Server, see [DB2OnCloudSetup](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/DB2OnCloudSetup).\n\nSince release 4.3.2 you can use the `search.reopt` query optimizer hint to improve the performance of certain search queries involving multiple search parameters. This optimization is currently only available for Db2. Valid values are \"ALWAYS\" and \"ONCE\". See Db2 documentation for `REOPT` for more details.\n\n##### PostgreSQL\nIf you configure the FHIR server to use a PostgreSQL database, you must:\n\n1. create the database if it doesn't already exist\n\n2. execute the `fhir-persistence-schema` utility with a db-type of `postgresql` to create the necessary schemas (tables, indices, functions, etc)\n\nAn executable `fhir-persistence-schema` jar can be downloaded from the project's [Releases tab](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/releases) and documentation can be found at https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-persistence-schema.\n\nSince release 4.5.5 you can set the `searchOptimizerOptions/from_collapse_limit` and `searchOptimizerOptions/join_collapse_limit` properties to improve the performance of certain search queries involving multiple search parameters. This optimization is currently only available for PostgreSQL.\n\n##### Other\n\nTo enable the IBM FHIR Server to work with other relational database systems, see\nhttps://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/BringYourOwnPersistence#adding-support-for-another-relational-database\n\n\n#### 3.3.1.2 Datastore configuration examples\nTo understand how the configuration properties are defined for one or more datastores, let's start off with a couple of examples.\n\n##### Example 1\nHere is a simple example of a single (default) Derby datastore.\n\n**config/default/fhir-server-config.json**\n```json\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"factoryClassname\":\"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n            \"datasources\": {\n                \"default\": {\n                    \"type\": \"derby\",\n                    \"currentSchema\": \"APP\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**configDropins/overrides/datasource-derby.xml**\n```xml\n<server>\n    <library id=\"fhirSharedLib\">\n        <fileset dir=\"${shared.resource.dir}/lib/derby\" includes=\"*.jar\"/>\n    </library>\n\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- TENANT: default; DSID: default; TYPE: read-write               -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_default_default\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedXADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibDerby\"/>\n        <properties.derby.embedded createDatabase=\"create\" databaseName=\"derby/fhirDB\"/>\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"50\" minPoolSize=\"10\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n</server>\n```\n\nIn this example, we define an embedded Derby database named `derby/fhirDB` (a location relative to the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server` directory). The datastore-id associated with this datastore is `default`, which is the value that is used if no `X-FHIR-DSID` request header is found in the incoming request. So, when only a single database is being used, it's wise to leverage the `default` datastore-id value to allow REST API consumers to avoid having to set the `X-FHIR-DSID` request header on each request.\n\n##### Example 2\nThis example shows a slightly more complex scenario. In this scenario, the `acme` tenant would like to store data in one of two study-specific Db2 databases with datastore-id values `study1` and `study2`.\n\nFurthermore, the REST API consumers associated with Acme applications will be coded to always set the `X-FHIR-TENANT-ID` request header to be `acme` and the `X-FHIR-DSID` request header to the specific datastore-id associated with each request (either `study1` or `study2`). In this case, the following properties would be configured:\n\n**config/acme/fhir-server-config.json**\n```json\n{\n    \"__comment\":\"Acme's FHIR server configuration\",\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"factoryClassname\":\"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n            \"datasources\": {\n                \"study1\": {\n                    \"tenantKey\": \"<the-tenant-key>\",\n                    \"type\": \"db2\",\n                    \"currentSchema\": \"DB2INST1\"\n                },\n                \"study2\": {\n                    \"tenantKey\": \"<the-tenant-key>\",\n                    \"type\": \"db2\",\n                    \"currentSchema\": \"DB2INST1\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**configDropins/overrides/datasources-acme.xml**\n```xml\n<server>\n    <library id=\"fhirSharedLib\">\n        <fileset dir=\"${shared.resource.dir}/lib/db2\" includes=\"*.jar\"/>\n    </library>\n\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- TENANT: acme; DSID: study1; TYPE: read-write                   -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_acme_study1\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2XADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibDb2\"/>\n        <properties.db2.jcc\n            serverName=\"dbserver1\"\n            portNumber=\"50000\"\n            user=\"db2inst1\"\n            password=\"change-password\"\n            databaseName=\"ACMESTUDY1\"\n            currentSchema=\"DB2INST1\"\n            driverType=\"4\"\n         />\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"200\" minPoolSize=\"20\"\n            connectionTimeout=\"60s\" maxIdleTime=\"2m\"\n            numConnectionsPerThreadLocal=\"0\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- TENANT: acme; DSID: study2; TYPE: read-write                   -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_acme_study2\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2XADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibDb2\"/>\n        <properties.db2.jcc\n            serverName=\"dbserver1\"\n            portNumber=\"50000\"\n            user=\"db2inst1\"\n            password=\"change-password\"\n            databaseName=\"ACMESTUDY2\"\n            currentSchema=\"DB2INST1\"\n            driverType=\"4\"\n         />\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"200\" minPoolSize=\"20\"\n            connectionTimeout=\"60s\" maxIdleTime=\"2m\"\n            numConnectionsPerThreadLocal=\"0\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n</server>\n```\n\nNote that because this example is using the default FHIR server naming scheme for datasource JNDI names, there is no need to include the 'jndiName' property in the fhir-server-config.json, although you can specify it should you wish to make the mapping clear.\n\nAdditionally, note that each datasource definition in the configDropin gets its own connection pool with properties defined by the 'connectionManager' element.\n\n#### 3.3.1.3 Database Access TransactionManager Timeout\nThe TransactionManager controls the timeout of database queries.  \n\nTo modify the default transaction timeout value, set the environment variable `FHIR_TRANSACTION_MANAGER_TIMEOUT` or enter the value in the server.env file at the root of the WLP fhir-server instance. Example values are `120s` (seconds) or `2m` (minutes).\n\n## 3.4 “Update/Create” feature\nNormally, the _update_ operation is invoked with a FHIR resource which represents a new version of an existing resource. The resource specified in the _update_ operation would contain the same id of that existing resource. If a resource containing a non-existent id were specified in the _update_ invocation, an error would result.\n\nThe FHIR specification defines optional behavior for the _update_ operation where it can create a new resource if a non-existent resource is specified in the invocation. The FHIR server supports this optional behavior via the `fhirServer/persistence/common/updateCreateEnabled` configuration parameter. If this configuration parameter is set to `true` (the default), then the _update_ operation will create a new resource if it is invoked with a resource containing a non-existent id. If the option is set to false, then the optional behavior is disabled and an error would be returned.\n\nThe following example shows the JSON for enabling _update_ operations to create resources:\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"common\":{\n                \"updateCreateEnabled\":true\n            }\n        }\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# 4 Customization\nYou can modify the default server implementation by taking advantage of the IBM FHIR server's extensibility. The following extension points are available:\n * Custom operations framework:  The IBM FHIR Server defines an operations framework that builds on the FHIR OperationDefinition resource in order to extend the FHIR REST API with custom endpoints.\n * Pluggable audit service:  Logging and auditing options including Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) over Apache Kafka.\n * Persistence interceptors:  Intercept requests before and/or after each persistence action.\n * Resource validation:  FHIRPath-based validation of FHIR resources on create or update with the ability to extend the system with custom constraints.\n\n## 4.1 Extended operations\nIn addition to the standard REST API (create, update, search, and so forth), the IBM FHIR Server supports the [FHIR operations framework](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/operations.html).\n\n### 4.1.1 Packaged operations\nThe FHIR team provides implementations for the standard `$validate`, `$document`, `$everything`, `$expand`, `$lookup`, `$subsumes`, `$closure`, `$export`, `$import`, `$convert`, `$apply` and `$translate` operations, as well as a custom operation named `$healthcheck`, which queries the configured persistence layer to report its health.\n\nThe server also bundles `$reindex` to reindex instances of Resources so they are searchable, `$retrieve-index` to retrieve lists of resources available to be reindexed, and `$erase` to hard delete instances of Resources. To learn more about the $erase operation, read the [design document](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/operation/fhir-operation-erase/README.md).\n\nTo extend the server with additional operations, see [Section 4.1.2 Custom operations](#412-custom-operations)\n\n#### 4.1.1.1 $validate\nThe `$validate` operation checks whether the attached content would be acceptable either generally, or as a create, update, or delete against an existing resource instance or type. By default, the `$validate` operation will validate a resource against the base specification and any profiles asserted in its `Resource.meta.profile` element. The default behavior may be changed in one of the following ways:\n* If a profile is specified via the optional `profile` parameter, the $validate operation will validate a resource against the base specification and the specified profile only. It will not validate against any other profiles asserted in the `Resource.meta.profile` element.\n* If the `profile` parameter is not specified, but the `mode` parameter is specified, and the `mode` parameter value is either `create` or `update`, the $validate operation will validate a resource against the base specification and any profiles asserted in its `Resource.meta.profile` element, but will do so based on profile configuration properties specified in the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles` section of the `fhir-server-config.json` file (see the [Configuration properties reference](#51-configuration-properties-reference) for configuration details).\n\nhttps://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/resource-operation-validate.html\n\n#### 4.1.1.2 $healthcheck\nThe `$healthcheck` operation returns the health of the FHIR server and its datastore. In the default JDBC persistence layer, this operation creates a connection to the configured database and return its status. The operations returns `200 OK` when healthy. Otherwise, it returns an HTTP error code and an `OperationOutcome` with one or more issues.\n\n### 4.1.2 Custom operations\nIn addition to the provided operations, the FHIR server supports user-provided custom operations through a Java Service Provider Interface (SPI).\n\nTo contribute an operation:\n1. Implement each operation as a Java class that extends `com.ibm.fhir.operation.AbstractOperation` from `fhir-operation.jar`. Ensure that your implementation returns an appropriate `OperationDefinition` in its `getDefinition()` method, because the framework validates both the request and response payloads to ensure that they conform to the definition.\n\n2. Create a file named `com.ibm.fhir.operation.FHIROperation` with one or more fully qualified `FHIROperation` classnames and package it in your jar under `META-INF/services/`.\n\n3. Include your jar file under the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/userlib/` directory of your installation.\n\n4. Restart the FHIR server. Changes to custom operations require a server restart, because the server discovers and instantiates operations during server startup only.\n\nAfter you register your operation with the server, it is available via HTTP POST at `[base]/api/1/$<yourCode>`, where `<yourCode>` is the value of your OperationDefinition's [code](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/operationdefinition-definitions.html#OperationDefinition.code).\n\n## 4.2 Notification Service\nThe FHIR server provides a notification service that publishes notifications about persistence events, specifically _create_, _update_, and _delete_ operations. The notification service can be used by other components to trigger specific actions that need to occur as resources are being updated in the FHIR server datastore.\n\nThe notification service supports two implementations: WebSocket and Kafka.\n\n### 4.2.1 FHIRNotificationEvent\nThe `FHIRNotificationEvent` class defines the information that is published by the notification service. Each notification event published to the WebSocket or Kafka topic is an instance of `FHIRNotificationEvent`, serialized as a JSON object. This JSON object will have the following fields:\n\nField name     | Type   | Description\n|--------------| -----  | ------------|\n`operationType`| String | The operation associated with the notification event. Valid values are _create_ and _update_.\n`location`     | String | The location URI of the resource associated with the notification event. To retrieve this resource, invoke a GET request using the location URI value as the URL string.\n`lastUpdated`  | String | The date and time of the last update made to the resource associated with the notification event.\n`resourceId`   | String | The logical id of the resource associated with the notification event.\n`resource`     | String | A stringified JSON object which is the resource associated with the notification event.\n`tenantId`     | String | The tenant that generated this notification\n`datasourceId` | String | The datasource used by the tenant\n\nThe following JSON is an example of a serialized notification event:\n\n```\n{\n  \"lastUpdated\":\"2016-06-01T10:36:23.232-05:00\",\n  \"location\":\"Observation/3859/_history/1\",\n  \"operationType\":\"create\",\n  \"resourceId\":\"3859\",\n  \"tenantId\":\"default\",\n  \"datasourceId\":\"default\",\n  \"resource\":{ …<contents of resource>… }\n}\n```\n\nIf the resource is over the limit specified in `fhirServer/notifications/common/maxNotificationSizeBytes`, the default value is to subset `id`, `meta`, `resourceType`, and all Resource required fields and add the subset to the FHIRNotificationEvent. In alternative configurations, user may set `fhirServer/notifications/common/maxNotificationSizeBehavior` to `omit` and subsequently retrieve the resource using the location.\n\n### 4.2.2 WebSocket\nThe WebSocket implementation of the notification service will publish notification event messages to a WebSocket. To enable WebSocket notifications, set the `fhirServer/notifications/websocket/enabled` property to `true`, as in the following example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"notifications\":{\n            …\n            \"websocket\":{\n                \"enabled\":true\n            }\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe WebSocket location URI is `ws://<host>:<port>/fhir-server/api/v4/notification`, where `<host>` and `<port>` represent the host and port of the FHIR server's REST API endpoint. So for example, if the FHIR server endpoint's base URL is `https://localhost:9443/fhir-server/api/v4` then the corresponding location of the WebSocket would be `ws://localhost:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/notification`.\n\n### 4.2.3 Kafka\nThe Kafka implementation of the notification service will publish notification event messages to a Kafka topic. To configure the Kafka notification publisher, configure properties in the `fhir-server-config.json` file as indicated in the following example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"notifications\":{\n            …\n            \"kafka\":{\n                \"enabled\":true,\n                \"topicName\":\"fhirNotifications\",\n                \"connectionProperties\":{\n                    \"group.id\":\"securing-kafka-group\",\n                    \"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9093\",\n                    \"security.protocol\":\"SSL\",\n                    \"ssl.truststore.location\":\"resources/security/kafka.client.truststore.jks\",\n                    \"ssl.truststore.password\":\"change-password\",\n                    \"ssl.keystore.location\":\"resources/security/kafka.client.keystore.jks\",\n                    \"ssl.keystore.password\":\"change-password\",\n                    \"ssl.key.password\":\"change-password\",\n                    \"ssl.truststore.type\":\"JKS\",\n                    \"ssl.keystore.type\":\"JKS\"\n                }\n            }\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `fhirServer/notifications/kafka/enabled` property is used to enable or disable the Kafka publisher component.\n\nThe `fhirServer/notifications/kafka/topicName` property is used to configure the appropriate topic name to which the notification events should be published.\n\nThe `fhirServer/notifications/kafka/connectionProperties` property group is used to configure the properties necessary to successfully connect to the Kafka server. You can specify an arbitrary `group.id`. The `bootstrap.servers` property is required, but the rest are optional, although if your Kafka server is configured to require an SSL connection and client authentication, then the remaining properties must also be set. For more details about Kafka-related properties, see the Kafka documentation.\n\nIn the `connectionProperties` property group in preceding example, you'll notice that the password-related properties have encoded values. To store a value requiring security (such as a password), you can use Liberty's `securityUtility` command to encode the value. See [Section 3.1 Encoded passwords](#31-encoded-passwords) for details.\n\nBefore you enable Kafka notifications, it's important to understand the topology of the environment in which the FHIR server instance will be running. Your topic name selection should be done in consideration of the topology. If you have multiple instances of the FHIR server clustered together to form a single logical endpoint, then each of those instances should be configured to use the same Kafka topic for notifications. This is so that notification consumers (subscribers) can subscribe to a single topic and receive all the notifications published by each of the FHIR server instances within the cluster.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have two completely independent FHIR server instances, then you should configure each one with its own topic name.\n\nThe FHIRNotificationEvent is asynchronous by default. If you want to specify a synchronous request, you can set `fhirServer/notifications/kafka/sync` to true, which ensures no message is lost in publishing, however it does add latency in each request.\n\n### 4.2.3 NATS\nThe [NATS](http://nats.io) implementation of the notification service publishes notification event messages to a NATS streaming cluster. To configure the NATS notification publisher, configure properties in the `fhir-server-config.json` file as shown in the following example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        ...\n        \"notifications\":{\n            ...\n            \"nats\": {\n\t\t        \"enabled\": true,\n\t\t        \"cluster\": \"nats-streaming\",\n\t\t        \"channel\": \"fhirNotifications\",\n\t\t        \"clientId\": \"fhir-server\",\n\t\t        \"servers\": \"nats://nats-node1:4222,nats://nats-node2:4222,nats://nats-node3:4222\",\n\t\t        \"useTLS\": true,\n\t\t        \"truststoreLocation\": \"resources/security/nats.client.truststore.p12\",\n\t\t        \"truststorePassword\": \"change-password\",\n\t\t        \"keystoreLocation\": \"resources/security/nats.client.keystore.p12\",\n\t\t        \"keystorePassword\": \"change-password\"\n    }\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSet the `fhirServer/notifications/nats/enabled` property to true and provide the name of your NATS cluster for the value of `fhirServer/notifications/nats/cluster`.  You may leave `fhirServer/notifications/nats/channel` and `fhirServer/notifications/nats/clientId` as defined.  Provide the URL for one or more NATS servers as the value for `fhirServer/notifications/nats/servers`.\n\nTo use TLS to connect to your NATS cluster, set `fhirServer/notifications/nats/useTLS` to true and provide client truststore and keystore locations and passwords as the remaining config values. Ensure that your NATS cluster is configured for TLS client connections.\n\nTo store a value requiring security, such as a password, use Liberty's `securityUtility` command to encode the value. See Section 3.1 Encoded passwords for details.\n\n### 4.2.4 Resource type filtering\nBy default, notification messages are published for all _create_ and _update_ persistence operations. However, the FHIR server allows you to configure a list of resource types for which notification events will be published. To do this, list the resource types for which you want to generate notifications in an array of strings within the  `fhirServer/notifications/common/includeResourceTypes` property in the `fhir-server-config.json` file, as in the following example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"notifications\":{\n            …\n            \"common\":{\n                \"includeResourceTypes\":[\n                     \"Observation\",\n                     \"Patient\"\n                ]\n            },\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith the `includeResourceTypes`property set as in the preceding example, the FHIR server publishes notification events only for `Patient` and `Observation` resources. If you omit this property or set its value to `[]` (an empty array), then the FHIR server publishes notifications for all resource types.\n\n## 4.3 Persistence interceptors\nThe IBM FHIR Server supports a persistence interceptor feature that enables users to add their own logic to the REST API processing flow around persistence events. This can be used to enforce application-specific business rules associated with resources. Interceptor methods are called immediately before or after each persistence operation.\n\n### 4.3.1 FHIRPersistenceInterceptor interface\nA persistence interceptor implementation must implement the `com.ibm.fhir.server.spi.interceptor.FHIRPersistenceInterceptor` interface.\n\nEach interceptor method receives a parameter of type `FHIRPersistenceEvent`, which contains context information related to the request being processed at the time that the interceptor method is invoked. It includes the FHIR resource, security information, request URI information, and the collection of HTTP headers associated with the request.\n\nThere are many use cases for persistence interceptors:\n\n1.  Enforce certain application-specific governance rules, such as making sure that a patient has signed a consent form prior to allowing his/her data to be persisted. For example, the `beforeCreate` and `beforeUpdate` methods could verify that the patient has a consent agreement on file and, if not, then throw a `FHIRPersistenceInterceptorException` to prevent the _create_ or _update_ events from completing. The exception thrown by the interceptor method should include one or more OperationOutcome issues and these issues will be added to an `OperationOutcome` in the REST API response. The HTTP status code of the response will be determined by the IssueType of the first issue in the list.\n\n2.  Perform additional access control. For example, `beforeSearch` can be used to alter the incoming SearchContext (e.g. by adding additional search parameters). Similarly `afterRead`, `afterVRead`, `afterHistory`, and `afterSearch` can be used to verify that the end user is authorized to access the resources before they are returned.\n\nIt is also possible to modify the incoming resources from the `beforeCreate` and `beforeUpdate` methods. For example, an interceptor could be used to add tags to resources on their way into the server. However, it is important to realize that interceptors are called *after* resource validation. Therefore, interceptor authors must be careful not to alter the resources in a way that breaks conformance with the profiles claimed in Resource.meta.profile or the secondary constraints in the specification. When in doubt, interceptors that modify the incoming resource can use the FHIRValidator to re-validate the resource(s) after they are altered.\n\n### 4.3.2 Implementing a persistence interceptor\nTo implement a persistence interceptor, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Develop a Java class which implements the `FHIRPersistenceInterceptor` interface.\n2.  Store the fully-qualified classname of your interceptor implementation class in a file called :\n\n      `META-INF/services/com.ibm.fhir.server.spi.interceptor.FHIRPersistenceInterceptor`\n\n    Here's an example of the file contents:\n\n    `com.ibm.mysolution.MyInterceptor`\n\n3.  Copy your jar to the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/userlib` directory so that it is accessible to the FHIR server via the classpath (the `server.xml` file contains a library element that defines this directory as a shared library).\n\n4.  Re-start the FHIR server.\n\n## 4.4 Registry resources\nThe IBM FHIR Server includes a dynamic registry of conformance resources.\nThe server pre-packages conformance artifacts from [HL7 FHIR version 4.3.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/downloads.html)\nand uses a Java ServiceLoader to discover additional registry resource providers on the classpath.\n\nThe server consults this registry for:\n* StructureDefinition, ValueSet, and CodeSystem resources for resource validation.\n* SearchParameter and CompartmentDefinition resources for search.\n* ValueSet and CodeSystem resources for terminology operations.\n* And more.\n\nOne common technique for extending FHIR with a set of conformance resources is to build or reference an [Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/implementationguide.html).\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server includes a [PackageRegistryResourceProvider](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide#making-profiles-available-to-the-fhir-registry-component-fhirregistry) for registering implementation guide resources.\n\nAdditionally, we [pre-package a number of popular implementation guides](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide#optional-profile-support) and make those available from both our GitHub Releases and [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/ibm/fhir/).\n\nFinally, the IBM FHIR Server includes a built-in ServerRegistryResourceProvider that can be used to bridge conformance resources from the tenant data store (uploaded through the REST API) to the registry.\nThis provider can be enabled/disabled via the `fhirServer/core/serverRegistryResourceProviderEnabled` property, but we recommend leaving it disabled for performance-intensive workloads.\n\n## 4.5 Resource validation\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the IBM FHIR Server registry is consulted during resource validation.\n\n### 4.5.1 HL7 spec-defined validation support\nThe FHIR specification provides a number of different validation resources including:\n\n1.  XML Schemas\n2.  ISO XML Schematron rules\n3.  Structure Definitions / Profiles for standard resource types, data types and built-in value sets\n\nThe FHIR server validates incoming resources for create and update interactions using the resource definitions and their corresponding FHIRPath constraints. Additionally, the FHIR server provides the [$validate](#411-packaged-operations) operation that API consumers can use to POST resources and get validation feedback:\n```\nPOST <base>/<resourceType>/$validate\n```\n\n### 4.5.2 Extension validation\nFHIR resources can be extended. Each extension has a url and servers can use these urls to validate the contents of the extension.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server performs extension validation by looking up the extension definition in its internal registry.\nIf an instance contains extensions that are unknown to the server, then the server will include a validation warning that indicates this extension could not be validated.\n\n### 4.5.3 Profile validation\nThe IBM FHIR Server can be extended with custom profile validation. This allows one to apply validation rules on the basis of the `Resource.meta.profile` values included on the resource instance.\n\nFor example, you can configure a set of FHIRPath Constraints to run for resources that claim conformance to the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partner` profile when you see an input resource like the following:\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Patient\",\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"profile\": [ \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partner\" ]\n    },\n    \"name\" : [ {\n        \"family\" : [ \"Doe\" ],\n        \"given\" : [ \"John\" ]\n    } ],\n    \"telecom\" : [ {\n        \"value\" : \"555-1234\",\n        \"system\": \"phone\",\n        \"use\" : \"home\"\n    } ],\n    \"birthDate\" : \"1950-08-15\"\n}\n```\n\nThe following configuration parameters can be used to specify rules relating to the set of profiles that are specified in a resource's `meta.profile` element:\n* `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/atLeastOne` - to specify a set of profiles, at least one of which a resource must claim conformance to and be successfully validated against in order to be persisted to the FHIR server.\n* `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/notAllowed` - to specify a set of profiles to which a resource is *not allowed* to claim conformance.\n* `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/allowUnknown` - to indicate whether a warning or an error is issued if a profile specified in a resource's `meta.profile` element is not loaded in the FHIR server. The default value is `true`, meaning unknown profiles are allowed to be specified. The profile will be ignored and just a warning will be returned. If set to `false`, this means unknown profiles are not allowed to be specified. An error will be returned and resource validation will fail.\n* `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/defaultVersions` - to specify which version of a profile will be used during resource validation if the profile specified in a resource's `meta.profile` element does not contain a version. If a default profile version is not configured using this configuration parameter for an asserted profile, the FHIR server will determine the default version to use for validation.\n\nBefore calling the FHIR validator to validate a resource against the set of profiles specified in its `meta.profile` element that it is claiming conformance to, the following pre-validation will be performed for that set of profiles based on the configuration parameters listed above:\n1. If any specified profile does not contain a version, and that profile is in the set of profiles configured to have a default version via the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/defaultVersions` configuration parameter, the default version for that profile will be appended to the profile name, and it is this new profile name containing the version which will be evaluated against in the following steps.\n2. If the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/notAllowed` configuration parameter is set to a non-empty list, an error will be returned for any specified profile that is in the list, and validation will fail.\n3. If the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/allowUnknown` configuration parameter is set to `false`,  an error will be returned for any specified profile that is not loaded in the FHIR server, and validation will fail.\n4. If the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/atLeastOne` configuration parameter is set to a non-empty list, an error will be returned if none of the specified profiles is in the list, and validation will fail.\n\nIf the resource passes pre-validation successfully, it will then be passed to the FHIR validator to validate conformance to the specified set of profiles.\n\nThe following example configuration shows how to define these configuration parameters:\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"resources\":{\n            \"open\": true,\n            \"Observation\": {\n                \"profiles\": {\n                    \"atLeastOne\": [\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerB|1.0\"\n                    ],\n                    \"allowUnknown\": false,\n                    \"defaultVersions\": {\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA\": \"1.1\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerE\": \"2.0\"\n                    }\n                }\n            },\n            \"Patient\": {\n                \"profiles\": {\n                    \"notAllowed\": [\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerC\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerD|2.0\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"Resource\": {\n                \"profiles\": {\n                    \"notAllowed\": [\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerF\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerG|4.0.0\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerH\"\n                    ],\n                    \"defaultVersions\": {\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerI\": \"1.0\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerJ\": \"3.1.1\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerK\": \"1.1\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\nGiven this configuration, in order for an `Observation` resource to be persisted to the FHIR server:\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element must specify either the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA` profile or the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerB|1.0` profile or both, based on the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/atLeastOne` list. Other profiles may be specified as well assuming they pass the following checks.\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element must not specify any profile which is specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles/notAllowed` list. Since the `notAllowed` property is not specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles` section, it is inherited from the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles` section if specified there.\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element must not specify any profile which is not loaded in the FHIR server, based on the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/allowUnknown` value of `false`.\n* The resource must successfully validate against all specified profiles. Note that if the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA` profile is specified, what is actually evaluated against and eventually passed to the FHIR validator is `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA|1.1`. This is because the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA` profile is specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/defaultVersions` set with a default version of `1.1`.\n\nIn order for a `Patient` resource to be persisted to the FHIR server:\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element is not required to specify any profile since the `atLeastOne` property is not specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Patient/profiles` section, nor is it specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles` section, where the property would be inherited from if specified. Any valid `Patient` profile may be specified assuming it passes the following checks.\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element cannot specify either the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerC` profile or the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerD|2.0` profile, based on the `fhirServer/resources/Patient/profiles/notAllowed` list.\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element may specify a profile which is not loaded in the FHIR server. Based on the absence of the `allowUnknown` property in the `fhirServer/resources/Patient/profiles` section, as well as the absence of that property in the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles` section (where the property would be inherited from if specified), the default value of `true` is used. This means unknown profiles (not loaded in the FHIR server) will be allowed and will simply be ignored.\n* The resource must successfully validate against all specified profiles. Note that since the `defaultVersions` property is not specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Patient/profiles` section, this property will be inherited from the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles/defaultVersions` property. So if a profile is specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element that is in the set of `defaultVersions` profiles, what will actually be evaluated against and eventually passed to the FHIR validator is the original profile name with its specified default version appended to it.\n\nIf a profile in either the list specified by the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/atLeastOne` configuration parameter or the list specified by the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/notAllowed` configuration parameter contains a version, for example `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partner|1.0`, then a profile of the same name specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element will only be considered a match if it contains exactly the same version. However, if a profile in the lists specified by the configuration parameters does not contain a version, for example `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partner`, then a profile of the same name specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element will be considered a match whether it contains a version or not.\n\nKeep in mind that a profile name specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element could be modified due to the resource's `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/defaultVersions` configuration. It is this modified profile name that is used in the matching process and in the resource's validation, but only for those purposes. The `meta.profile` element of the original resource itself is not updated with the modified profile name.\n\nUsing the example configuration above for the `Observation` resource type, if the profile `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA|3.2` was specified in a resource's `meta.profile` element then it would be considered a match for the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA` profile specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/atLeastOne` list. Conversely, if the profile `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerB` was specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element then it would *not* be considered a match for the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerB|1.0` profile specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/atLeastOne` list.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server pre-packages all conformance resources from the core specification.\n\nSee [Validation Guide - Optional profile support](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide#optional-profile-support) for a list of pre-built Implementation Guide resources and how to load them into the IBM FHIR server.\n\nSee [Validation Guide - Making profiles available to the fhir registry](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide#making-profiles-available-to-the-fhir-registry-component-fhirregistry) for information about how to extend the server with additional Implementation Guide artifacts.\n\n\n## 4.6 Extending search\nIn addition to supporting tenant-specific search parameter extensions as described in [Section 3.2.2 Tenant-specific configuration properties](#322-tenant-specific-configuration-properties), the IBM FHIR Server also supports loading\nsearch parameters from the registry.\n\nFor performance reasons, the registry search parameters are retrieved once and only once during startup.\n\nThe set of search parameters can filtered / refined via `fhirServer/resources/[resourceType]/searchParameters` as described in the [Search configuration guide](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRSearchConfiguration#13-filtering).\n\n## 4.7 FHIR client API\n\n### 4.7.1 Overview\nIn addition to the server, we also offer a Java API for invoking FHIR REST APIs. The IBM FHIR Client is built on JAX-RS 2.1 and provides a simple properties-driven client that can be configured for a given endpoint, mutual authentication, request/response logging, and more.\n\n### 4.7.2 Maven coordinates\nTo use the FHIR Client from your application, specify the `fhir-client` artifact as a dependency within your `pom.xml` file, as in the following example:\n\n```\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>com.ibm.fhir</groupId>\n            <artifactId>fhir-client</artifactId>\n            <version>${fhir.client.version}</version>\n        </dependency>\n```\n\n### 4.7.3 Client properties\nApplicable client properties are documented in the FHIRClient interface.\nBelow is a summary of the most pertinent ones:\n\n| Property | Default | Description |\n| -------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| fhirclient.rest.base.url<sup>*</sup> | | The target FHIR Server's [base URL](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#root) |\n| fhirclient.default.mimetype | application/fhir+json; fhirVersion=4.3 | The value to use in the HTTP headers (Accept and Content-Type) passed to the FHIR Server. |\n| fhirclient.truststore.location | | The client truststore's filename. The client truststore contains the server's public key certificates and is used to verify the server's identity. |\n| fhirclient.truststore.password | | The client truststore's password. |\n| fhirclient.hostnameVerification.enabled | true | Indicates whether or not to enable hostname verification when connecting over TLS. |\n| fhirclient.basicauth.enabled | false | Indicates whether Basic Authentication should be used. If enabled, then the username and password properties are required. |\n| fhirclient.basicauth.username | | The username to use with Basic Authentication. |\n| fhirclient.basicauth.password | | The password to use with Basic Authentication. |\n| fhirclient.clientauth.enabled | false | Indicates whether mutual TLS certificate-based authentication should be used. If enabled, then keystore properties are required. |\n| fhirclient.keystore.location | | The client keystore's filename. The client keystore constains the client's public/private key pair. When using client certificate-based authentication, this is now the client supplies its identity to the server|\n| fhirclient.keystore.password | | The client keystore's password. |\n| fhirclient.keystore.key.password | | The password associated with the client's certificate within the keystore. |\n| fhirclient.logging.enabled | false | Whether to enable request/response logging (useful for debug). |\n| fhirclient.http.receive.timeout | 130000 (130 seconds) | The time, in seconds, to wait for a server response. |\n\n### 4.7.4 Sample usage\nFor examples on how to use the IBM FHIR Client, look for tests like `com.ibm.fhir.client.test.mains.FHIRClientSample` from the `fhir-client` project in git. Additionally, the FHIR Client is heavilly used from our integration tests in `fhir-server-test`.\n\n## 4.8 Using local references within request bundles\nInter-dependencies between resources are typically defined by one resource containing a field of type `Reference` which contains an _external reference_<sup id=\"a5\">[5](#f5)</sup> to another resource. For example, an `Observation` resource could reference a `Patient` resource via the Observation's `subject` field. The value that is stored in the `Reference.reference` field (for example, `Observation.subject.reference` in the case of the `Observation` resource) could be an absolute URL, such as `https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/12345`, or a relative URL, such as `Patient/12345`.\n\nAs described above, in order to establish a reference to a resource, you must first know its resource identifier. However, if you are using a request bundle to create both the referenced resource (`Patient` in this example) and the resource which references it (`Observation`), then it is impossible to know the `Patient`resource identifier before the request bundle has been processed (that is, before the new `Patient` resource is created).\n\nThankfully, the HL7 FHIR specification defines a way to express a dependency between two resources within a request bundle by using a _local identifier_ to identify the resource being referenced, and a _local reference_<sup id=\"a6\">[6](#f6)</sup> to reference the resource via its local identifier. In the following example, a request bundle contains a `POST` request to create a new `Patient` resource, along with a `POST` request to create a new `Observation` resource that references that `Patient`:\n\n<a id=\"example-obs-ref-pat\"></a>\n\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\": \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\": \"batch\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"urn:uuid:7113a0bb-d9e0-49df-9855-887409388c69\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Patient\",\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Patient\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Observation\",\n            …\n            \"subject\" : {\n                \"reference\" : \"urn:uuid:7113a0bb-d9e0-49df-9855-887409388c69\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Observation\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nTo define a local identifier for a resource, you must specify it in the `Bundle.entry.fullUrl` field of the resource's bundle entry. The HL7 FHIR specification recommends that the local identifier be the persistent identity of the resource if known, otherwise a UUID value prefixed with `urn:uuid:` as in the preceding example. However, the FHIR server does not require the use of a UUID value. You can use any `fullUrl` value you like as long as it is unique within the bundle. For example, you can use `urn:Patient_1`, `urn:ABC`, or `urn:Foo`.\n\nAfter you define a local identifier for the referenced resource, you can then define one or more references to that resource by using the local identifier instead of an external identifier. In the preceding example, you can see that the Observation's `subject.reference` field specifies the Patient's local identifier as specified in the `fullUrl` field of the Patient's request entry.\n\n### 4.8.1 Processing rules\nThe following processing rules apply for the use of local references within a request bundle:\n1.  A local identifier must be defined via a request bundle entry's `fullUrl` field in order for that local identifier to be used in a local reference.\n2.  Local references will only be recognized for local identifiers associated with request bundle entries with a request method of `POST` or `PUT`.\n3.  `POST` requests will be processed before `PUT` requests.\n4.  <a id=\"order-dependency-rule\"></a>There is no order dependency within a request bundle for bundle entries defining local identifiers and bundle entries which reference those local identifiers via local references.\n5.  <a id=\"relative-reference-rule\"></a>If a resource in a request bundle entry contains a field of type `Reference` having a value which is a relative URL, and if that bundle entry has a local identifier (`fullUrl`) which is an absolute URL conforming to the FHIR specification's [RESTful URL definition](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/references.html#regex), then the FHIR server will attempt to resolve the local reference as follows, based on the [FHIR specification](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/bundle.html#references):\n    - it will extract the FHIR base URL from the local identifier and append the local reference to it\n    - it will then try to resolve the reference within the request bundle using the updated local reference\n\n    See the [relative local reference example](#example-ref-via-relative-local-ref) below for an illustration of this rule.\n\nIn the [example above](#example-obs-ref-pat), you can see that there are two POST requests and the `Patient` request entry appears in the bundle before the `Observation` request entry. However, based on the [order dependency processing rule](#order-dependency-rule), it would still be a valid request bundle even if the `Observation` request entry appeared before the `Patient` request entry.\n\nThe following examples also satisfy the local reference processing rules:\n\n#### Example: Circular references\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\" : \"batch\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"urn:Encounter_1\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Encounter\",\n            …\n            \"reasonReference\" : [ {\n                    \"reference\" : \"urn:Procedure_1\"\n            } ],\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Encounter\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"urn:Procedure_1\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Procedure\",\n            …\n            \"encounter\" : {\n                    \"reference\" : \"urn:Encounter_1\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Procedure\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nWhile processing a request bundle, but before processing individual request entries, the IBM FHIR server detects the use of a local identifier within any `POST` or `PUT` request entry's `fullUrl` field, and establishes a mapping between that local identifier and the corresponding external identifier that results from performing the `POST` or `PUT` operation.\n\nUsing the circular reference example above, the FHIR server detects the use of local identifiers in the `Encounter` request entry (`urn:Encounter_1`) and in the `Procedure` request entry (`urn:Procedure_1`), and establishes a mapping between the local identifiers and the external references to be associated with the new `Encounter` and `Procedure` resources (for example, `Encounter/1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b` and `Procedure/22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf`).\n\nThen when the FHIR server processes the POST requests for the `Encounter` and `Procedure` resources, it detects the use of the local references and substitutes the corresponding external references for them before creating the new resources. Below is the response bundle for the request bundle in the circular references example. We can see that the Encounter's `reasonReference.reference` field now contains a proper external reference to the newly-created `Procedure` resource, and the Procedure's `encounter.reference` field now contains a proper external reference to the newly-created `Encounter` resource:\n\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\" : \"batch-response\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Encounter\",\n            \"id\" : \"1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b\",\n            …\n            \"reasonReference\" : [ {\n                    \"reference\" : \"Procedure/22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf\"\n            } ],\n            …\n        },\n        \"response\" : {\n            \"id\" : \"1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b\",\n            \"status\" : \"201\",\n            \"location\" : \"Encounter/1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b/_history/1\",\n            \"etag\" : \"W/\\\"1\\\"\",\n            \"lastModified\" : \"2017-03-01T20:56:59.540Z\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Procedure\",\n            \"id\" : \"22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf\",\n            …\n            \"encounter\" : {\n                \"reference\" : \"Encounter/1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"response\" : {\n            \"id\" : \"22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf\",\n            \"status\" : \"201\",\n            \"location\" : \"Procedure/22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf/_history/1\",\n            \"etag\" : \"W/\\\"1\\\"\",\n            \"lastModified\" : \"2017-03-01T20:56:59.652Z\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Reference to entry with conditional create\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\" : \"batch\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Observation\",\n            \"id\" : \"25b1fe08-7612-45eb-af80-7e15d9806b2b\",\n            …\n            \"subject\" : {\n                    \"reference\" : \"urn:Patient_1\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"PUT\",\n            \"url\" : \"Observation/25b1fe08-7612-45eb-af80-7e15d9806b2b\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"urn:Patient_1\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Patient\",\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Patient\",\n            \"ifNoneExist\": \"identifier=http://my-system|123\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, even though the `Patient` request entry is a conditional create request, this is still a valid request bundle, because the FHIR server resolves any conditional requests before it establishes the mapping between local identifiers and the corresponding external identifiers that will result from performing the `POST` or `PUT` operation.\n\n#### <a id=\"example-ref-via-relative-local-ref\"></a>Example: Reference via relative local reference\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\" : \"batch\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/new\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Patient\",\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Patient\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Observation/new\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Observation\",\n            …\n            \"subject\" : {\n                \"reference\" : \"Patient/new\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Observation\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we demonstrate the [relative reference processing rule](#relative-reference-rule). The local identifiers for the request bundle entries (`https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/new` and `https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Observation/new`) are absolute URLs that conform to the FHIR specification's [RESTful URL definition](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/references.html#regex) . When the FHIR server attempts to resolve the `Observation` request entry's `subject` reference (`Patient/new`), it will apply the processing rule for relative references, since the reference is a relative URL. The `subject` reference will be modified to be the original local reference (`Patient/new`) appended to the FHIR base URL extracted from the `Observation` entry's local identifier (`https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/`). The resulting local reference  (`https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/new`) will then be a valid reference  to the `Patient` request bundle entry.\n\n## 4.9 Multi-tenancy\nThe FHIR server includes features that allow a single instance of the server to simultaneously support multiple tenants. A tenant is defined as a group of one or more FHIR REST API consumers that share a FHIR server configuration along with one or more data stores associated with that configuration. A tenant could be a single application using the FHIR REST API, or it could be a group of applications belonging to a single customer. The main idea behind multi-tenancy is that each tenant can experience its own customized FHIR server runtime behavior and its data can be physically isolated from other tenants' data for increased security and privacy.\n\n### 4.9.1 Specifying the tenant id\nTo support multi-tenancy, the FHIR server must know which tenant an incoming REST API request is intended for. To provide the tenant id to the FHIR server, a REST API consumer must set a request header in each REST API request. The name of this request header is itself configurable by setting the `fhirServer/core/tenantIdHeaderName` configuration property in the FHIR server's global configuration file (located at `$⁠{server.config.dir}/config/default/fhir-server-config.json`). The following example shows the default setting for this configuration parameter:\n```\n\n{\n  \"fhirServer\":{\n      \"core\":{\n            \"tenantIdHeaderName\":\"X-FHIR-TENANT-ID\"\n      },\n      …\n   }\n}\n```\n\nWith this configuration in place, each REST API consumer would need to set the `X-FHIR-TENANT-ID` request header to the appropriate tenant id. Each tenant's tenant id value is assigned by the deployer. It is simply a short name associated with the tenant and must be unique among all tenants supported by a single FHIR server instance. For example, let's suppose Acme Healthcare, Inc. is using the FHIR server and their tenant id has been assigned by the deployer as “acme”. In this case, Acme-related applications would set the following request header in each REST API request: `X-FHIR-TENANT-ID: acme`\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the name of the request header is configurable in the FHIR server's global configuration file. For example, the FHIR server deployer could configure the request header name to be `X-WHCLSF-tenant-id` by setting `tenantIdHeaderName` as shown in the following example:\n```\n{\n   \"fhirServer\":{\n      \"core\":{\n            \"tenantIdHeaderName\":\"X-WHCLSF-tenant-id\"\n      },\n      …\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThis would be useful in an environment where the applications might already be using a similar type of request header. With this configuration in place, the “Acme Healthcare, Inc.” tenant would set the following request header in each REST API request:\n    `X-WHCLSF-tenant-id: acme`\n\n\n### 4.9.2 Configuration properties\nThe FHIR server allows a deployer to configure a subset of the supported configuration properties on a tenant-specific basis.\nFor a complete list of configuration properties supported on a per-tenant basis, see [Section 5.1.3 Property attributes](#513-property-attributes).\n\nWhen the FHIR server needs to retrieve any of the tenant-specific configuration properties, it does so dynamically each time the property value is needed. This means that a deployer can change the value of a tenant-specific property within a tenant's configuration file on disk, and the FHIR server will immediately “see” the new value the next time it tries to retrieve it. For example, suppose the deployer initially defines the `acme` tenant's `fhir-server-config.json` file such that the `fhirServer/core/defaultPrettyPrint` property is set to true.\n\nRequests from the `acme` tenant would result in pretty-printed responses (with newlines and indentation), making it easier for humans to read.\nNow suppose the deployer changes the value of that property to true within the `acme` tenant's `fhir-server-config.json` file.\nA subsequent REST API request would then see the output condensed into a single line with minimal whitespace.\n\n#### 4.9.2.1 Examples\nThis section contains examples of both a global (default) configuration and a tenant-specific configuration.\n\n##### Global configuration (default)\nThe global configuration contains non-tenant specific configuration parameters (configuration parameters that are not resolved or used on a tenant-specific basis), as well as default values for tenant-specific configuration parameters.\n\n`${server.config.dir}/config/default/fhir-server-config.json`\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"__comment\":\"FHIR server global (default) configuration\",\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        \"core\":{\n            \"defaultPrettyPrint\":false,\n            \"tenantIdHeaderName\":\"X-FHIR-TENANT-ID\"\n        },\n        \"notifications\":{\n            \"common\":{\n                \"includeResourceTypes\":[\n                    \"QuestionnaireResponse\",\n                    \"CarePlan\",\n                    \"MedicationAdministration\",\n                    \"Device\",\n                    \"DeviceComponent\",\n                    \"DeviceMetric\",\n                    \"MedicationOrder\",\n                    \"Observation\"\n                ]\n            },\n            \"websocket\":{\n                \"enabled\":false\n            },\n            \"kafka\":{\n                \"enabled\":false,\n                \"topicName\":\"fhirNotifications\",\n                \"connectionProperties\":{\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        \"audit\": {\n            \"serviceClassName\" : \"com.ibm.fhir.audit.impl.NopService\",\n            \"serviceProperties\" : {\n            }\n        },\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"factoryClassname\":\"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n            \"common\":{\n                \"__comment\":\"Configuration properties common to all persistence layer implementations\",\n                \"updateCreateEnabled\":true\n            },\n            \"jdbc\":{\n                \"__comment\":\"Configuration properties for the JDBC persistence implementation\",\n            },\n        …\n        }\n    …\n    }\n```\n\n##### Acme Healthcare, Inc. (acme)\nThe Acme Healthcare, Inc tenant configuration overrides the `fhirServer/core/defaultPrettyPrint` property so that the development\nteam can more easilly read the messages.\n\n`${server.config.dir}/config/acme/fhir-server-config.json`\n\n```\n{\n    \"__comment\":\"FHIR server configuration for tenant: Acme Healthcare, Inc.\",\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        \"core\":{\n            \"defaultPrettyPrint\":true\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt is also possible to configure the persistence properties for a specific tenant, for example to set an alternate\ndatabase hostname or database schema name.\n\n## 4.10 Bulk data operations\nThe IBM FHIR Server implements bulk data export according to the [HL7 FHIR BulkDataAccess IG: STU1](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1/export/index.html), and bulk data import is implemented according to the [Proposal for $import Operation](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/bulk-import/blob/main/import.md).\n\nThere are 2 modules involved:\n\n- fhir-operation-bulkdata\n- fhir-bulkdata-webapp   \n\nThe *fhir-operation-bulkdata* module implements the REST APIs for bulk data export, import and status as FHIR Operations.  There are five operations:\n\n| Operation | Path |\n|-----|-----|\n| ExportOperation| system `$export` |\n| PatientExportOperation| Patient `Patient/$export` |\n| GroupExportOperation| Group `Group/[id]/$export` |\n| ImportOperation | import resources using the system endpoint, `$import` |\n| StatusOperation | polling status for import and export `$bulkdata-status` |\n\nEach operation queues a job with the Open Liberty JavaBatch framework. Each job instance unit-of-work is executed as a job with the *fhir-bulkdata-webapp* module. There are 5 JavaBatch jobs defined in the *fhir-bulkdata-webapp* module for the above 3 export operations and 1 import operation:\n\n| Java Batch Job | Operation |\n|-----|-----|\n| FhirBulkExportChunkJob| `$export` |\n| FhirBulkExportFastJob| `$export` |\n| FhirBulkExportPatientChunkJob| `Patient/$export` |\n| FhirBulkExportGroupChunkJob| `Group/[id]/$export` |\n| FhirBulkImportChunkJob | `$import` |\n\nThe *fhir-bulkdata-webapp* module is a wrapper for the whole BulkData web application, which is the build artifact - fhir-bulkdata-webapp.war. This web archive is copied to the `apps/` directory of the liberty server. The feature is configured using the `configDropins/default/bulkdata.xml`, such as:\n\n```xml\n<webApplication id=\"fhir-bulkdata-webapp\" location=\"fhir-bulkdata-webapp.war\" name=\"fhir-bulkdata-webapp\">\n    <classloader privateLibraryRef=\"configResources,fhirUserLib\"/>\n    <application-bnd>\n        <security-role id=\"users\" name=\"FHIRUsers\">\n            <group id=\"bulkUsersGroup\" name=\"FHIRUsers\"/>\n        </security-role>\n    </application-bnd>\n</webApplication>\n```\n\nThe Bulk Data web application writes the exported FHIR resources to an IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS), any Amazon S3-Compatible bucket (e.g, Amazon S3, minIO etc), or directory as configured in the per-tenant server configuration under `fhirServer/bulkdata`. The following is an example configuration for bulkdata; please refer to section 5 for the detailed description of these properties:\n\n``` json\n\"bulkdata\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"core\": {\n        \"api\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://localhost:9443/ibm/api/batch\",\n            \"user\": \"fhiradmin\",\n            \"password\": \"change-password\",\n            \"truststore\": \"resources/security/fhirTrustStore.p12\",\n            \"truststorePassword\": \"change-password\"\n        },\n        \"cos\" : {\n            \"useServerTruststore\": true\n        },\n        \"pageSize\": 100,\n        \"batchIdEncryptionKey\": \"example-password\",\n        \"maxPartitions\": 3,\n        \"maxInputs\": 5\n    },\n    \"storageProviders\": {\n        \"default\" : {\n            \"type\": \"file\",\n            \"fileBase\": \"/output/bulkdata\",\n            \"disableOperationOutcomes\": true,\n            \"duplicationCheck\": false,\n            \"validateResources\": false\n        },\n        \"minio\" : {\n            \"type\": \"aws-s3\",\n            \"bucketName\": \"fhirbulkdata\",\n            \"location\": \"us\",\n            \"endpointInternal\": \"https://minio:9000\",\n            \"endpointExternal\": \"https://localhost:9000\",\n            \"auth\" : {\n                \"type\": \"hmac\",\n                \"accessKeyId\": \"example\",\n                \"secretAccessKey\": \"example-password\"\n            },\n            \"disableBaseUrlValidation\": true,\n            \"disableOperationOutcomes\": true,\n            \"duplicationCheck\": false,\n            \"validateResources\": false,\n            \"create\": false,\n            \"presigned\": true\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEach tenant's configuration may define multiple storageProviders. The default is assumed, unless specified with the `X-FHIR-BULKDATA-PROVIDER` and `X-FHIR-BULKDATA-PROVIDER-OUTCOME`. Each tenant's configuration may mix the different providers, however each provider is only of a single type. For instance, `minio` is `aws-s3` and `default` is `file`. Note, type `http` is only applicable to `$import` operations. Export is only supported with s3 and file.\n\nTo use Amazon S3 bucket for exporting, please set `accessKeyId` to S3 access key, and set `secretAccessKey` to the S3 secret key, and the auth type to `hmac`.\n\nBasic system exports to S3 without typeFilters use a streamlined implementation which bypasses the IBM FHIR Server Search API for direct access to the data enabling better throughput. The `fhirServer/bulkdata/core/systemExportImpl` property can be used to disable the streamlined system export implementation. To use the legacy implementation based on IBM FHIR Server search, set the value to \"legacy\". The new system export implementation is used by default for any export not using typeFilters. Exports using typeFilters use FHIR Search, and cannot use the streamlined export.\n\nTo import using the `$import` operation with `https`, one must additionally configure the `fhirServer/bulkdata/storageProviders/(source)/validBaseUrls`. For example, if one stores bulk data at `https://test-url1.cos.ibm.com/bucket1/test.ndjson` and `https://test-url2.cos.ibm.com/bucket2/test2.ndjson` you must specify both baseUrls in the configuration:\n\n```json\n    \"validBaseUrls\": [\n        \"https://test-url1.cos.ibm.com/bucket1\",\n        \"https://test-url2.cos.ibm.com/bucket2\"\n    ]\n```\n\nThese base urls are not checked when using cloud object store and bulk-import. If you need to disable the validBaseUrls feature you may add `fhirServer/bulkdata/storageProviders/(source)/disableBaseUrlValidation` as `true`.\n\nFor Bulk Data import, the `fhirServer/bulkdata/core/maxInputs` is used to configure a maximum number of inputs supported by the instance. The default number is 5. There is a hard character limit on the total input type and url must be under 4096 characters, as such the configuration may be tuned for each url scheme.\n\nNote: When `$import` is executed, if a resource to import includes a `Resource.id` then this id is honored (via create-on-update). If `Resource.id` is not valued, the server will perform a create and assign a new `Resource.id` for this resource.\n\nFollowing is the beautified response of sample polling location request after the export is finished:\n\n```json\n{\n\"transactionTime\": \"2020/01/20 16:53:41.160 -0500\",\n\"request\": \"https://myserver/fhir-server/api/v4/$export?_type=Patient\",\n\"requiresAccessToken\": false,\n\"output\" : [\n  { \"type\" : \"AllergyIntolerance\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/fhir-bulkimexport-connectathon/6SfXzbGvYl1nTjGbf5qeqJDFNjyljiGdKxXEJb4yJn8=/AllergyIntolerance_1.ndjson\",\n    \"count\": 20},\n  { \"type\" : \"AllergyIntolerance\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/fhir-bulkimexport-connectathon/6SfXzbGvYl1nTjGbf5qeqJDFNjyljiGdKxXEJb4yJn8=/AllergyIntolerance_2.ndjson\",\n    \"count\": 8},\n  { \"type\" : \"Observation\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/fhir-bulkimexport-connectathon/6SfXzbGvYl1nTjGbf5qeqJDFNjyljiGdKxXEJb4yJn8=/Observation_1.ndjson\",\n    \"count\": 234},\n  { \"type\" : \"Observation\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/fhir-bulkimexport-connectathon/6SfXzbGvYl1nTjGbf5qeqJDFNjyljiGdKxXEJb4yJn8=/Observation_2.ndjson\",\n    \"count\": 81}]\n}\n```\n\nFor the Import Operation, the polled status includes an indication of `$import` and the location of the OperationOutcome NDJSON files and the corresponding failure and success counts.\n\nFor S3 exports, the bulk data feature may use presigned urls.  To enable presigned urls, the authentication type must be `hmac` and `fhirServer/bulkdata/storageProviders/(source)/presigned` must be `true`.  The urls become:\n\n```\nhttps://s3.appdomain.cloud/fhir-example/Patient_1.ndjson?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=fcEXbf9cc1ac49e99eEX77%2F20210228%2Fus%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210EXT160538Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5ecfc207546b9737fd38d4f0EXEX1c58f4f82976338a44c\n```\n\nThe presigned URL is valid for 86400 seconds (1 day).\n\nTo cancel a running job (or delete a completed job), issue an HTTP DELETE request to the polling URL.\n* Invoking DELETE on a running job will return HTTP 202 (Accepted) and stop the job\n* Invoking DELETE on a completed job will return HTTP 204 (Deleted) and delete the job\n* Invoking DELETE on a deleted job will return a 404 (Not Found)\n\nPrior to version 4.8.1, the exported `ndjson` file is configured with public access automatically and with 2 hours expiration time using `fhirServer/bulkdata/storageProviders/(source)/exportPublic`. The exported content is best made available with  presigned urls with the `hmac` authentication type.\n\nIn 4.8.1, the randomly generated path is used to uniquely identify the exported files in a single folder.\n\nJavaBatch feature must be enabled in `server.xml` as following on the Liberty server:\n\n```xml\n<featureManager>\n    ...\n    <feature>batchManagement-1.0</feature>\n    ...\n</featureManager>\n```\n\nThe JavaBatch user is configured in `bulkdata.xml` and the `fhir-server-config.json`:\n\n```xml\n<authorization-roles id=\"com.ibm.ws.batch\">\n\t<security-role name=\"batchAdmin\">\n\t\t<user name=\"fhiradmin\"/>\n\t</security-role>\n\t<security-role name=\"batchSubmitter\">\n\t\t<user name=\"fhiruser\"/>\n\t</security-role>\n\t<security-role name=\"batchMonitor\">\n\t\t<user name=\"fhiradmin\"/>\n\t\t<user name=\"fhiruser\"/>\n\t</security-role>\n</authorization-roles>\n```\n\nNote: The batch-user referenced in the `fhir-server-config.json` must have a role of at least batchSubmitter.\n\nBy default, in-memory Derby database is used for persistence of the JavaBatch Jobs as configured in `fhir-server/configDropins/defaults/bulkdata.xml`. This database is destroyed on the restart of the IBM FHIR Server, and does not support load balancing.\n\nTo support IBM Db2 on IBM Cloud, copy `fhir-server/configDropins/disabled/db2-cloud/bulkdata.xml` to `fhir-server/configDropins/defaults/bulkdata.xml` replacing the existing bulkdata.xml. One can configure the Datasource by setting the following environment variables:\n\n| Variable          | Default     | Description                                                    |\n|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| BATCH_DB_HOSTNAME | `blank`     | The hostname of the db2 instance                               |\n| BATCH_DB_NAME     | BLUDB       | The database name                                              |\n| BATCH_DB_SCHEMA   | FHIR_JBATCH | The Schema Name configured to support the Java Batch framework |\n| BATCH_DB_PORT     | 50001       | The port configured to support the database                    |\n| BATCH_DB_APIKEY   | `blank`     | The API Key for the Db2 Cloud database                         |\n\nInstruction is also provided in 'Configuring a Liberty Datasource with API Key' section of the DB2OnCloudSetup guide to configure DB2 service in IBM Clouds as JavaBatch persistence store. The JavaBatch schema is created using the `fhir-persistence-schema` command line interface jar.\n\nTo support IBM Db2 with a user-name and password , copy `fhir-server/configDropins/disabled/db2/bulkdata.xml` to `fhir-server/configDropins/defaults/bulkdata.xml` replacing the existing bulkdata.xml. One can configure the Datasource by setting the following environment variables:\n\n| Variable          | Default         | Description                                                    |\n|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| BATCH_DB_HOSTNAME | `blank`         | The hostname of the db2 instance                               |\n| BATCH_DB_NAME     | FHIRDB          | The database name                                              |\n| BATCH_DB_SCHEMA   | FHIR_JBATCH     | The Schema Name configured to support the Java Batch framework |\n| BATCH_DB_PORT     | 50000           | The port configured to support the database                    |\n| BATCH_DB_USER     | db2inst1        | The user for the Db2 database                                  |\n| BATCH_DB_PASSWORD | `blank`         | The password for the Db2 database                              |\n| BATCH_DB_SSL      | true            | The ssl connection is either true or false                     |\n\nIf one wants to support Postgres with a user-name and password , one should copy `fhir-server/configDropins/disabled/postgres/bulkdata.xml` to `fhir-server/configDropins/defaults/bulkdata.xml` replacing the existing bulkdata.xml. One can configure the Datasource by setting the following environment variables:\n\n| Variable               | Default         | Description                                                    |\n|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| BATCH_DB_HOSTNAME      | `blank`         | The hostname of the postgres instance                          |\n| BATCH_DB_NAME          | FHIRDB          | The database name                                              |\n| BATCH_DB_SCHEMA        | FHIR_JBATCH     | The Schema Name configured to support the Java Batch framework |\n| BATCH_DB_PORT          | 5432            | The port configured to support the database                    |\n| BATCH_DB_USER          | fhirserver      | The user for the postgres database                             |\n| BATCH_DB_PASSWORD      | `blank`         | The password for the postgres database                         |\n| BATCH_DB_SSL           | true            | The ssl connection is either true or false                     |\n| BATCH_DB_SSL_CERT_PATH | false           | The ssl connection is either true or false                     |\n\nNote: If you use PostgreSQL database as IBM FHIR Server data store or the JavaBatch job repository, please enable `max_prepared_transactions` in postgresql.conf, otherwise the import/export JavaBatch jobs fail.\n\nFor more information about Liberty JavaBatch configuration, please refer to [IBM WebSphere Liberty Java Batch White paper](https://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/webindex/wp102544).\n\nIf you are running in a Kubernetes deployment, be sure to set the environment variable MY_POD_NAME to `metadata.name` as shown in [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/Alvearie/alvearie-helm/blob/main/charts/ibm-fhir-server/templates/deployment.yaml#:~:text=MY_POD_NAME). This setting allows the stopping and deleting of jobs on all the hosts in the deployment.\n\n### 4.10.1 *Path* and *Virtual Host* Bucket Access\n\nFor BulkData storage types of `ibm-cos` and `aws-s3`, the IBM FHIR Server supports two styles of accessing the `s3` bucket - virtual host and path.  In the IBM FHIR Server, `path` is the default access. [Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html)\n\nWith path style access, the objects in a bucket are accessed using the pattern - `https://s3.region.host-name.com/bucket-name/object-key`. To configure path style access, one needs to configure the fhir-server-config.json.\n\nThere are three critical elements in the configuration to configure path style:\n\n|Configuration|Details|\n|-------------|-------|\n|`endpointInternal`|the direct S3 API provider for the S3 API|\n|`endpointExternal`|the endpoint url used to generate the downloadUrl used in S3 Export|\n|`accessType`|\"path\", the default access type|\n\nExample of `path` based access:\n\n``` json\n\"bulkdata\": {\n    ...\n    \"storageProviders\": {\n        \"default\" : {\n            \"type\": \"aws-s3\",\n            \"bucketName\": \"bucket-name\",\n            \"location\": \"us\",\n            \"endpointInternal\": \"https://s3.region.host-name.com\",\n            \"endpointExternal\": \"https://s3.region.host-name.com\",\n            \"auth\" : {\n                \"type\": \"hmac\",\n                \"accessKeyId\": \"example\",\n                \"secretAccessKey\": \"example-password\"\n            },\n            \"disableBaseUrlValidation\": true,\n            \"disableOperationOutcomes\": true,\n            \"duplicationCheck\": false,\n            \"validateResources\": false,\n            \"create\": false,\n            \"presigned\": true,\n            \"accessType\": \"path\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith virtual host style access, the objects in a bucket are accessed using the pattern - `https://bucket-name.s3.region.host-name.com/object-key`. To configure virtual host style access, one needs to configure the API.\n\nThere are three critical elements in the configuration to configure virtual host style:\n\n|Configuration|Details|\n|-------------|-------|\n|`endpointInternal`|the direct API provider for the S3 API, and not the virtual host, the underlying S3 libraries generate the virtual host url|\n|`endpointExternal`|the Virtual Host endpoint url used to generate the downloadUrl generated after an Export|\n|`accessType`|\"host\"|\n\nNote, while the endpointInternal is specified with the S3 region endpoint, the calls to the API will use the virtual host directly.\n\nExample of `host` based access:\n\n``` json\n\"bulkdata\": {\n    ...\n    \"storageProviders\": {\n        \"default\" : {\n            \"type\": \"aws-s3\",\n            \"bucketName\": \"bucket-name\",\n            \"location\": \"us\",\n            \"endpointInternal\": \"https://s3.region.host-name.com\",\n            \"endpointExternal\": \"https://bucket-name.s3.region.host-name.com\",\n            \"auth\" : {\n                \"type\": \"hmac\",\n                \"accessKeyId\": \"example\",\n                \"secretAccessKey\": \"example-password\"\n            },\n            \"disableBaseUrlValidation\": true,\n            \"disableOperationOutcomes\": true,\n            \"duplicationCheck\": false,\n            \"validateResources\": false,\n            \"create\": false,\n            \"presigned\": true,\n            \"accessType\": \"host\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.10.2 S3 Import File with matching segments\n\nWhen Importing from an S3 Bucket, the IBM FHIR Server identifies the matching file segments. The `parameter.input.url` is used to query the S3 API to find the matching files.  For instance, the following import of `Patient.ndjson` matches `Patient.ndjson_seg0` and `Patient.ndjson_seg1` which are imported to the IBM FHIR Server.\n\nThis feature is useful for imports which follow a prefix pattern:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"resourceType\": \"Parameters\",\n    \"id\": \"30321130-5032-49fb-be54-9b8b82b2445a\",\n    \"parameter\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"inputFormat\",\n            \"valueString\": \"application/fhir+ndjson\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"inputSource\",\n            \"valueUri\": \"https://localhost:9443/source-fhir-server\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"input\",\n            \"part\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"type\",\n                    \"valueString\": \"Patient\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"url\",\n                    \"valueUrl\": \"test-import.ndjson\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"storageDetail\",\n            \"valueString\": \"ibm-cos\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### 4.10.3 Integration Testing\nTo integration test, there are tests in `ExportOperationTest.java` in `fhir-server-test` module with server integration test cases for system, patient and group export. Further, there are tests in `ImportOperationTest.java` in `fhir-server-test` module. These tests rely on the `fhir-server-config-db2.json` which specifies two storageProviders.\n\n### 4.10.5 Job Logs\nBecause the bulk import and export operations are built on Liberty's java batch implementation, users may need to check the [Liberty batch job logs](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_batch_view_joblog.html) for detailed step information / troubleshooting.\n\nIn a standard installation, these logs will be at `wlp/usr/servers/fhir-server/logs/joblogs`.\nIn the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, these logs will be at `/logs/joblogs`.\n\nNote, if you are using the default derby, the logs are overwritten upon restart of the server. You should use Db2 or Postgres for production purposes.\n\n### 4.10.6 Known Limitations\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server's fhir-bulkdata-webapp does not support [persistence interceptors](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/blob/main/docs/src/pages/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide.md#43-persistence-interceptors). Therefor, $import requests will not lead to `beforeCreate`/`beforeUpdate` or `afterCreate`/`afterUpdate` method calls and $export requests will not lead to `beforeRead`/`beforeSearch` or `afterRead`/`afterSearch` method calls.\nBecause the IBM FHIR Server's notifications feature is implemented as a persistence interceptor, bulk operations will not result in any notification events.\n\n## 4.11 Audit logging service\nThe Audit logging service pushes FHIR server audit events for FHIR operations in [Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF)](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf) standard format to a Kafka backend, such as *IBM Cloud Event Streams service*.\n\nThere is early support for the [FHIR Standard: AuditEvent format](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/auditevent.html).\n\n### 4.11.1 CADF audit log entry\n\nEach FHIR interaction triggers a CADF audit log entry to be logged. The mapping of FHIR interaction to CADF action is as follows:\n\n| FHIR Interaction                                    | CADF Action |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n|`history,metadata,read,search,validate,version read` |   read      |\n|`create`                                             |   create    |\n|`update`                                             |   update    |\n|`delete`                                             |   delete    |\n|`bundle,custom operation,patch`                      |   unknown   |\n\nThe following table describes the JSON fields of the CADF audit log entries logged by the FHIR server:\n\n| CADF Audit Log Entry Field                           | Description |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n|`action`                                              |Action that created the audit event.

Possible values are \"success\", \"failure\", \"unknown\", and \"pending\".|\n|`typeURI`                                             |TypeURI property of the CADF event entity. Value is always \"http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event\".|\n|`attachments`                                         |Note: Contains FHIR server-specific audit event data.|\n|`attachments/contentType`                             |FHIR server-specific audit event data content type. Value is always \"application/json\".|\n|`attachments/content`                                 |Note: Contents of this field (with its subfields) is encoded as Base64.\n|`attachments/content/request_unique_id`               |Globally unique identifier for the FHIR server request.|\n|`attachments/content/action`                          |FHIR action type.

The first type is using the environment variable, and the second is the configuration driven from the fhir-server-config.json.\n\nFor example, the following uses the 'config' in order to config the Kafka publisher as part of the audit logging service.\n\n```\n\"audit\": {\n    \"serviceClassName\" : \"com.ibm.fhir.audit.impl.KafkaService\",\n    \"serviceProperties\" : {\n        \"load\": \"config\",\n    }\n```\n\nOr, you could load from an environment, note, this is the default behavior.\n\n```\n\"audit\": {\n    \"serviceClassName\" : \"com.ibm.fhir.audit.impl.KafkaService\",\n    \"serviceProperties\" : {\n        \"load\": \"environment\",\n    }\n```\n\n#### 4.11.3.1 Environment Variable Configuration of audit logging service\n\nThe audit logging service gets the event streams service credential from environment variable EVENT_STREAMS_AUDIT_BINDING with values like this:\n\n```\n    {\n  \"api_key\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n  \"apikey\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n   …\n  \"kafka_brokers_sasl\": [\n    \"broker-1-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-2-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-5-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-4-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-3-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-0-0server:9093\"\n  ],\n   …\n}\n```\n\nIf you are using the IBM EventStreams on IBM Cloud, the service credential can be generated automatically when you run:\n\n```\n    ibmcloud ks cluster-service-bind --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --namespace <namespace> --service <event_streams_service_instance_name> …\n```\n\nto bind your event streams service instance to your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nAnd then in the YAML file for your Kubernetes deployment, specify the environment variable EVENT_STREAMS_AUDIT_BINDING that references the binding key of the generated secret(binding-<event_streams_service_instance_name>) as following:\n\n```\n            - name: EVENT_STREAMS_AUDIT_BINDING\n                valueFrom:\n                  secretKeyRef:\n                    key: binding\n                    name: binding-<event_streams_service_instance_name>\n```\n\nPlease refer to https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-binding for detailed instructions if needed.\n\n#### 4.11.3.2 fhir-server-config.json Configuration of audit logging service\n\n```\n\"audit\": {\n    \"serviceClassName\" : \"com.ibm.fhir.audit.impl.KafkaService\",\n    \"serviceProperties\" : {\n        \"load\": \"config\",\n        \"mapper\": \"cadf\",\n        \"auditTopic\": \"FHIR_AUDIT\",\n        \"geoCity\": \"Dallas\",\n        \"geoState\": \"TX\",\n        \"geoCounty\": \"US\",\n        \"kafka\" : {\n            \"sasl.jaas.config\": \"********\",\n            \"bootstrap.servers\": \"********\",\n            \"sasl.mechanism\": \"PLAIN\",\n            \"security.protocol\": \"SASL_SSL\",\n            \"ssl.protocol\": \"TLSv1.2\",\n            \"ssl.enabled.protocols\": \"TLSv1.2\",\n            \"ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm\": \"HTTPS\"\n        },\n        \"kafkaServers\": \"********\",\n        \"kafkaApiKey\": \"********\"\n    }\n```\n\nThe service can map to the CADF format or the FHIR AuditEvent resource format by declaring a mapper type - 'cadf' or 'auditevent'.\n\n- *CADF* Example\n```\n{\n    \"action\": \"create\",\n    \"eventTime\": \"2020-12-10 16:49:22.307\",\n    \"eventType\": \"activity\",\n    \"id\": \"c62ee8f8-be77-49d0-aad0-c0bf52a05fdf\",\n    \"outcome\": \"success\",\n    \"typeURI\": \"http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event\",\n    \"tags\": [\n    ],\n    \"target\": {\n        \"id\": \"176629076d7-ef3e8608-cd07-4c20-8823-ddfe46237052\",\n        \"typeURI\": \"data/database\",\n        \"addresses\": [\n            {\n                \"url\": \"https://test.io:443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient\",\n                \"name\": \"\",\n                \"port\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"geolocation\": {\n            \"city\": \"Hamil\",\n            \"state\": \"TEXAS\",\n            \"region\": \"USA\",\n            \"annotations\": [\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"attachments\": [\n        {\n            \"contentType\": \"application/json\",\n            \"content\": \"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\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"initiator\": {\n        \"id\": \"default@fhir-server\",\n        \"typeURI\": \"compute/machine\",\n        \"host\": \"192.168.86.20\",\n        \"credential\": {\n            \"token\": \"user-fhiruser\"\n        },\n        \"geolocation\": {\n            \"city\": \"Dallas\",\n            \"state\": \"TX\",\n            \"region\": \"US\",\n            \"annotations\": [\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"observer\": {\n        \"id\": \"fhir-server\",\n        \"typeURI\": \"compute/node\",\n        \"name\": \"IBM FHIR Server -

Another option is to configure Event Streams (Kafka) S3 connect to push those CADF events to a COS bucket (e.g. fhir-audit-dev) but in raw CADF json format.\n\nA service instance of the [IBM Cloud SQL Query](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/analyzing-data-with-ibm-cloud-sql-query) service can be created to allow you to query those CADF audit events in COS with SQL queries. Before running an SQL query, it's recommended to first create a COS bucket to store your query results, otherwise the query results will be stored in a bucket which is automatically created by the SQL query service.\n\nSample queries for CSV records expanded from the JSON CADF events:\n\n```\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-07\" and \"2019-06-08\" and action=\"unknown\" into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as csv\n\nselect action, count(*) from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-05\" and \"2019-06-06\" group by action into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as csv\n\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-05\" and \"2019-06-06\" and action=\"create\" and initiator_id=\"default@fhir-server\" into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as csv\n\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-05\" and \"2019-06-06\" and ATTACHMENTS_CONTENT LIKE '%fhir-read%' into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as csv\n```\n\nSample queries for the raw JSON CADF events:\n\n```\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0 stored as json where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-01\" and \"2019-06-08\" and action=\"unknown\" into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0-res stored as json\n\nselect action, count(*) from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0 stored as json where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-01\" and \"2019-06-06\" group by action into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0-res stored as csv\n\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0 stored as json where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-01\" and \"2019-06-06\" and action=\"create\" and initiator.id=\"default@fhir-server\" into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as json\n\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0 stored as json where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-01\" and \"2019-06-06\" and ATTACHMENTS[0].CONTENT LIKE '%fhir-read%' into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as json\n\n```\n\n## 4.12 FHIR REST API\nBy default, the IBM FHIR Server allows the following RESTful interactions associated with the FHIR REST API: `create`, `read`, `vread`, `history`, `search`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`. However, it is possible to configure which of these interactions are allowed on a per resource basis through a set of interaction rules specified via the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property in `fhir-server-config.json`. The following snippet shows the general form for specifying interaction rules:\n\n```\n\"resources\": {\n    \"open\": true,\n    \"Condition\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Observation\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Patient\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\"]\n    },\n    \"Procedure\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"delete\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property is a JSON array of strings that represent the RESTful interactions allowed for the given resource type. If an interaction is not in the list of strings specified for a resource type, that interaction will not be allowed for that resource type. In the example above, the following interactions are allowed for the `Observation` resource type: [`create`, `read`, `vread`, `history`, `delete`]. This means a user will not be able to search for `Observation` resources because the `search` interaction is not specified in the list of allowed interactions.\n\nOmitting the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property is equivalent to allowing all interactions for a given resource type. An empty array, `[]`, can be used to indicate that no interactions are allowed. Additionally, to define the set of interactions allowed for resource types which are not specifically configured in the `fhirServer/resources` property group, or for resource types which are configured, but which do not specify the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property, the base type of `Resource` may be specified:\n\n```\n\"resources\": {\n    \"open\": true,\n    \"Condition\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\", \"update\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Observation\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Patient\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\"]\n    },\n    \"Procedure\": {\n    },\n    \"Resource\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, for any resource type which is not specifically configured, such as `Encounter`, or for any resource type which is configured but does not specify the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property, such as `Procedure`, all of the interactions listed for the `Resource` resource type will be allowed.\n\nOne final consideration when configuring interactions is the `fhirServer/resources/open` property. If this property is specified and its value is set to `false`, then no interactions will be allowed for resource types which are not specifically listed in the `fhirServer/resources` property group. Assume the following configuration:\n\n```\n\"resources\": {\n    \"open\": false,\n    \"Condition\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\", \"update\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Observation\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Patient\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, since the `fhirServer/resources/open` property is set to `false`, only the resource types listed (`Condition`, `Observation`, `Patient`) are allowed to be interacted with via the FHIR REST API. For example, a `create` request of a `Procedure` resource will fail since that resource type is not specified.\n\nWhole-system search and whole-system history are special cases. Since no resource type is specified on a whole-system request, validation will be done against the `Resource` resource type. In the above configuration example, a whole-system search request such as `GET [base]?_lastUpdated=gt2020-01-01` will fail because the `Resource` resource type is not specified. If the configuration were to have the `fhirServer/resources/open` property set to `true`, or if the `Resource` resource type were specified in the `fhirServer/resources` property group, then the whole-system search request would be allowed, assuming the `search` interaction was valid for the `Resource` resource type.\n\nIn addition to interaction configuration, the `fhirServer/resources` property group also provides the ability to configure search parameter filtering and profile validation. See [Search configuration](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRSearchConfiguration#13-filtering) and [Resource validation](#44-resource-validation) respectively for details.\n\nUnlike most other tenant-specific properties, the `fhirServer/resources` property group is processed as a single unit. In the event that `fhirServer/resources` exists in a tenant-specific config, but a particular sub-property is missing (e.g. `fhirServer/resources/open`), that sub-property will *not* inheret from the \"default\" tenant.\n\n## 4.12.1 Using the IBM FHIR Server behind a proxy\nIt is possible to run the IBM FHIR Server behind a reverse proxy such as Kubernetes Ingress or an API Gateway.\n\nBecause the FHIR API relies on links and references between resources (both absolute and relative), operators must ensure that the IBM FHIR Server is configured appropriately for the front-end URL being used by the FHIR clients.\n\nThis can be accomplished by configuring the `fhirServer/core/originalRequestUriHeaderName` property in the default fhir-server-config.json. When this parameter is configured, the IBM FHIR Server will use the value of the corresponding header to set the \"originalRequestUri\" for the scope of the request.\n\nFor example, consider a FHIR Server that is listening at https://fhir:9443/fhir-server/api/v4 and is configured with an  originalRequestUriHeaderName of `X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL`. If this server is proxied by a server at https://example.com/fhir, then the proxy must set the `X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL` header to the value of the front-end request URL (e.g. https://example.com/fhir/Patient/abc-123). In alternative deployments, the `fhirServer/core/externalBaseUrl` may be used in-lieu of the `X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL`.\n\nThe originalRequestUriHeader is expected to contain the full path of the original request. Values with no scheme (e.g. `https://`) will be handled like relative URLs, but full URL values (including scheme, hostname, optional port, and path) are recommended. Query string values can be included in the header value but will be ignored by the server; the server will use the query string of the actual request to process the request.\n\n### 4.13 Remote Index Service\n\nTo use the experimental remote index service feature, see the instructions documented in the [fhir-remote-index](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/operation/fhir-remote-index/README.md) project.\n\n# 5 Appendix\n\n## 5.1 Configuration properties reference\nThis section contains reference information about each of the configuration properties supported by the FHIR server.\n\n### 5.1.1 Property descriptions\n| Property Name                 | Type | Description     |\n|-------------------------------|------|-----------------|\n|`fhirServer/core/defaultPrettyPrint`|boolean|A boolean flag which indicates whether \"Pretty Printing\" should be used by default.

5.2 Keystores, truststores, and the IBM FHIR server\n\n### 5.2.1 Background\nAs stated earlier, the FHIR server is installed with a default configuration in `server.xml` which includes the definition of a keystore (`fhirKeyStore.p12`) and a truststore (`fhirTrustStore.p12`)<sup id=\"a7\">[7](#f7)</sup>. These files are provided only as examples and while they may suffice in a test environment, the FHIR server deployer should generate a new keystore and truststore for any installations where security is a concern. Review the information in the following topics to learn how to configure a secure keystore and truststore.\n\nAdditionally, the server has a trustDefault.xml config dropin that references the SEC_TLS_TRUSTDEFAULTCERTS variable (defaultValue = true) to indicate whether or not the JVM truststore should be used in combination with the configured trust store.\n\n### 5.2.2 WebApp security\nBy default, the FHIR server REST API is only available via HTTPS on port 9443 and is protected by HTTP basic authentication.\nAlternatively, the server can use OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 via a Bearer Token as described in [Section 5.3 OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0](#53-openid-connect-and-oauth-20).\nIn addition, the FHIR server web application can be secured via client certificate-based authentication.\n\nHere are some notes related to these authentication schemes:\n*   Basic authentication is a very simple authentication scheme and should only be used over HTTPS because the username and password are essentially transmitted in plain text.\n*   OAuth 2.0 authentication can only be used in conjunction with an HTTPS endpoint because the OAuth authorization steps rely on SSL handshake negotiations.\n*   Client certificate-based authentication can only be used in conjunction with an HTTPS endpoint since it involves SSL handshake negotiations. The main value of client authentication is that the server is able to securely authenticate the client through the use of certificates.\n\n### 5.2.3 Configuring mutual TLS authentication\nTo properly configure the FHIR server's keystore and truststore files, perform the following steps.\n\n### 5.2.3.1 Configure the keyStores\n1.  Create a new self-signed server certificate<sup id=\"a8\">[8](#f8)</sup> and store it in a new keystore file located in the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/resources/security` directory.\n\n    In these instructions, we'll call this file `serverKeystore.jks`, although you can name your server keystore file anything you choose. We'll use the `keytool`<sup id=\"a9\">[9](#f9)</sup> command for all keystore- and truststore-related steps, although there are several ways to perform these actions.\n\n    The following command will generate a new self-signed certificate and store it in `serverKeystore.jks`:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore serverKeystore.jks -storepass change-password -genkey\n        -alias default -keyalg RSA -keypass change-password\n    ```\n\n2.  Export the server certificate so that it can be imported into the client's truststore:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore serverKeystore.jks -storepass change-password -export\n        -alias default -file server-public-key.cer\n    ```\n\n3.  Create the client's certificate and store it in `clientKeystore.jks`:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore clientKeystore.jks -storepass change-password -genkey\n        -alias client-auth -keyalg RSA -keypass change-password\n    ```\n\n    Note: `keytool` will prompt you for the various components of the distinguished name (DN) associated with the certificate (similar to Step 1). The value that you specify for the common name (CN) component of the DN must match a username in the basic user registry<sup id=\"a10\">[10](#f10)</sup> configured within the `server.xml` file. This step is crucial for the client certificate-based authentication to work properly. The whole point of this authentication scheme is for the client to transmit its identity to the server via the client certificate, and the client's username must be contained in that certificate (the CN component of the DN) so that the FHIR server can properly authenticate the client.\n\n4.  Export the client's certificate so that it can be imported into the server's truststore:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore clientKeystore.jks -storepass change-password -export -alias client-auth -file client-public-key.cer\n    ```\n\n5.  Import the server's public key certificate into the client's truststore:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore clientTruststore.jks -storepass change-password -import -file server-public-key.cer\n    ```\n\n6.  Import the client's public key certificate into the server's truststore:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore serverTruststore.jks -storepass change-password -import -file client-public-key.cer\n    ```\n\nAt this point, you should have a client keystore that contains a client certificate whose Distinguished Name's Common Name component is set to the username. You should also have a client truststore which contains the server's public key certificate. Essentially, the server and client both have a keystore that contains their own private and public key certificate and they both have a truststore which contains the public key certificate of their counterpart.\n\n### 5.2.3.1 Configure the server\nCopy the server keystore (`serverKeystore.jks`) and truststore (`serverTruststore.jks`) files to the appropriate directory (`<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/resources/security`). Then configure the `server.xml` file correctly to reference your new keystore and truststore files.\n\n### 5.2.3.2 Configure the client\nThe precise steps required to configure certificate-based authentication for a client application depend on the specific REST API client framework, but these are the general rules:\n\n*   If the client is using the FHIR server's HTTPS endpoint, then the client's truststore should be configured with the certificate of the FHIR server<sup id=\"a11\">[11](#f11)</sup>.\n*   If the client is using basic authentication, then it must send an appropriate Authorization request header containing the username and password information in the HTTP request.\n*   If the client is using client certificate-based Authentication, then the client keystore must be configured with a certificate that is trusted by the FHIR server<sup id=\"a12\">[12](#f12)</sup>.\n*   If the client is using OAuth 2.0 Authentication, then the client keystore must be configured with the REST API client framework. In addition, it must send an appropriate Authorization request header containing the Bearer token in the HTTP request.\n\n## 5.3 OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0\nThe FHIR specification recommends the use of OAuth 2.0.\nThe IBM FHIR Server supports OAuth 2.0 through the use of WebSphere Liberty / OpenLiberty features.\n\nWhile it is possible to configure Liberty as an [OpenID Connect Client](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html), more typically the IBM FHIR Server will be configured as a generic OAuth 2.0 \"Protected Resource Server\" that works with JWT access tokens that have been issued by a trusted Authorization Server like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org).\n\n### 5.3.1 Configure Liberty to be an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Server\nLiberty can be configured to act as an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Server via either the [openidConnectClient feature](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/core?topic=connect-configuring-oauth-20-protected-resources-in-liberty) or the [mpJwt feature](https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-jwt.html).\n\nOne advantage of the mpJwt approach is that users can be mapped into pre-defined JEE security roles.\nTo enable this feature without modifying the default `server.xml`, move the `jwtRS.xml` config snippet from `configDropins/disabled/` to `configDropins/defaults/` and modify as desired.\n\nA copy of this snippet is provided here for illustrative purposes:\n```xml\n<server description=\"fhir-server\">\n    <featureManager>\n        <feature>mpJwt-1.1</feature>\n    </featureManager>\n\n    <!-- Override the application-bnd binding of the main webapp -->\n    <webApplication contextRoot=\"fhir-server/api/v4\" id=\"fhir-server-webapp\" location=\"fhir-server.war\" name=\"fhir-server-webapp\">\n        <application-bnd id=\"bind\">\n            <security-role id=\"users\" name=\"FHIRUsers\">\n                <group id=\"usersGroup\" access-id=\"group:https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test/fhirUser\"/>\n            </security-role>\n        </application-bnd>\n    </webApplication>\n\n    <mpJwt id=\"jwtConsumer\"\n           jwksUri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/certs\"\n           issuer=\"https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test\"\n           audiences=\"http://fhir-server:9080/fhir-server/api/v4\"\n           userNameAttribute=\"sub\"\n           groupNameAttribute=\"group\"\n           authFilterRef=\"filter\"/>\n\n    <authFilter id=\"filter\">\n        <requestUrl urlPattern=\"/fhir-server\" />\n        <requestUrl matchType=\"notContain\" urlPattern=\"/fhir-server/api/v4/metadata\" />\n        <requestUrl matchType=\"notContain\" urlPattern=\"/fhir-server/api/v4/.well-known/smart-configuration\" />\n    </authFilter>\n</server>\n```\n\nIn the snippet above, the `mpJwt` element is configured to obtain JWK information from http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/certs and use this to validate JWT tokens that are passed to the server.\n\nAdditionally, the server will validate the `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audiences) claims of the JWT and use the `sub` claim as the user principal (for audit logging).\n\nFinally, the value(s) of the `group` claim are used to map this user into a corresponding JEE security-role as defined in the `application-bnd` section of the `webApplication` element.\n\n### 5.3.2 Advertise the OAuth endpoints via fhir-server-config\nTo make the FHIR Server advertise the OAuth endpoints of the configured provider, supply values for at least the following properties in the default fhir-server-config.json file:\n* `fhirServer/security/oauth/authUrl`\n* `fhirServer/security/oauth/tokenUrl`\n\nThese values will be used to populate the corresponding entries in both the server capability statement (`GET [base]/metadata`) and the smart-configuration (`GET [base]/.well-known/smart-configuration`).\n\nFor example, the following excerpt from a CapabilityStatement shows sample OAuth-related URLs (register, authorize, and token) values in the `valueUri` elements.\n```\n…\n\"rest\": [\n    {\n        \"mode\": \"server\",\n        \"security\": {\n        \"extension\": [\n            {\n                \"url\": \"http://fhir-registry.smarthealthit.org/StructureDefinition/oauth-uris\"\n                \"extension\": [\n                    {\n                        \"url\": \"authorize\",\n                        \"valueUri\": \"https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/auth\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"url\": \"token\",\n                        \"valueUri\": \"https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/token\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"url\": \"register\",\n                        \"valueUri\": \"https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test/clients-registrations/openid-connect\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ],\n        …\n```\n\nSMART on FHIR applications should use the `.well-known/smart-configuration` endpoint to determine the OAuth URLs to use for authorization,\nbut the entries in the Capability Statement are needed for backwards compatibility.\n\n### 5.3.3 SMART App Launch\nTo support [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch), the IBM FHIR Server can be used with a SMART-enabled authorization server. For an example of a SMART-enabled Authorization Server, see the [Alvearie Keycloak extensions for FHIR](https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir).\n\nThe OAuth configuration described in the previous sections will restrict API access to clients with a valid access token.\nHowever, SMART defines additional access controls via OAuth 2.0 scopes and context parameters.\n\nTo enforce authorization policy on the server, drop the `fhir-smart` module into the server's userlib directory.\n\nThis component uses the IBM FHIR Server's PersistenceInterceptor feature to automatically scope searches to the compartments for which the user has access (as indicated by a special `patient_id` claim in the access token).\n\nAdditionally, before returning resources to the client, the `fhir-smart` component performs authorization policy enforcement based on the list of SMART scopes included in the token's `scope` claim and the list of patient compartments in the `patient_id` claim.\n\nWhen the HTTP header `Prefer: return=minimal` is specified on a search or history request, only minimal resource metadata is retrieved. In those cases, either `user` or `system` SMART scopes must be used, since the resource data necessary to enforce access via `patient` SMART scopes is not available.\n\nFor an example of using the IBM FHIR Server together with a SMART-enabled Keycloak authorization server, please see the data-access pattern at https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-patterns/tree/main/data-access.\n\n## 5.4 Custom HTTP Headers\nIBM FHIR Server Supports the following custom HTTP Headers:\n\n| Header Name      | Description                |\n|------------------|----------------------------|\n|`X-FHIR-TENANT-ID`|Specifies which tenant config should be used for the request. Default is `default`. The header name can be overridden via config property `fhirServer/core/tenantIdHeaderName`.|\n|`X-FHIR-DSID`|Specifies which datastore config should be used for the request. Default is `default`. The header name can be overridden via config property `fhirServer/core/dataSourceIdHeaderName`.|\n|`X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL`|The original (user-facing) request URL; used for constructing absolute URLs within the server response. Only enabled when explicitly configured in the default fhir-server-config.json. If either the config property or the header itself is missing, the server will use the actual request URL. The header name can be overridden via config property `fhirServer/core/originalRequestUriHeaderName`. Note that `fhirServer/core/externalBaseUrl` overrides the `X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL` and is used to construct the absolute URL. Also note that the base URL's value must not include a path segment that matches any FHIR resource type name (case-sensitive). For example, \"https://example.com\" or \"https://example.com/my/patient/api\" are fine, but \"https://example.com/my/Patient/api\" is not.|\n|`X-FHIR-FORCE-UPDATE`|By default, when the server receives an update request, it performs a resource comparison and only performs the update if the contents of the resource have changed. Set this header to true to skip that check and perform a normal update (i.e. create a new version for this resource id).|\n\n# 6 Related topics\nFor more information about topics related to configuring a FHIR server, see the following documentation:\n*   [Java 11 Keytool documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/keytool.html)\n*   [WebSphere Liberty documentation: Configuring your web application and server for client certificate authentication](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_sec_clientcert.html)\n*   [Java EE 7 Tutorial, Chapter 50](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/security-advanced002.htm#GLIEN)\n*   [WebSphere Liberty documentation: Defining an OAuth Service Provider](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_oauth_defining.html)\n*   [WebSphere Liberty documentation: Configuring an Open ID Connect Client in liberty](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_config_oidc_rp.html)\n\n<hr/>\n\n- <b name=\"f1\">1</b>\n\n    The fhir-server-config.json file contains configuration information associated with the FHIR server.

Prereqs: The IBM FHIR Server requires Java 11 and has been tested with OpenJDK 11. To install Java on your system, we recommend downloading and installing OpenJDK 11 from https://adoptium.net/.\n\n1.  To install the IBM FHIR Server, build or download the `fhir-install` zip installer.\nThe Maven build creates the zip package under `fhir-install/target`. Alternatively, releases are available from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/fhir/releases).\n\n2.  Unzip the `.zip` package into a clean directory (referred to as `fhir-installer` here):\n    ```\n        mkdir fhir-installer\n        cd fhir-installer\n        unzip fhir-server-distribution.zip\n    ```\n\n3.  Determine an install location for the OpenLiberty server and the IBM FHIR Server webapp. Example:  `/opt/ibm/fhir-server`\n\n4.  Run the `install.sh/.bat` script to install the server:\n    ```\n        ./fhir-server-dist/install.sh /opt/ibm/fhir-server\n    ```\n    This step installs the OpenLiberty runtime and the IBM FHIR Server web application. The Liberty runtime is installed in a directory called `wlp` within the installation directory that you specify. For example, in the preceding command, the root directory of the Liberty server runtime would be `/opt/ibm/fhir-server/wlp`.\n\n5.  Configure the fhir-server's `server.xml` file as needed by completing the following steps:\n    * Configure the ports that the server listen on. The server is installed with only port 9443 (HTTPS) enabled by default. To change the port numbers, modify the values in the `httpEndpoint` element.\n    * Configure a server keystore and truststore. The IBM FHIR Server is installed with a default keystore file that contains a single self-signed certificate for localhost. For production use, you must create and configure your own keystore and truststore files for the FHIR server deployment (that is, generate your own server certificate or obtain a trusted certificate, and then share the public key certificate with API consumers so that they can insert it into their client-side truststore). The keystore and truststore files are used along with the server's HTTPS endpoint and the FHIR server's client-certificate-based authentication protocol to secure the FHIR server's endpoint. For more information, see [Section 5.2 Keystores, truststores, and the FHIR server](#52-keystores-truststores-and-the-fhir-server).\n    * Configure an appropriate user registry. The FHIR server is installed with a basic user registry that contains a single user named `fhiruser`. For production use, it's best to configure your own user registry. For more information about configuring user registries, see the [OpenLiberty documentation](https://openliberty.io/guides/security-intro.html#configuring-the-user-registry).\n\n    To override the default fhiruser's password, one may set an Environment variable `FHIR_USER_PASSWORD` and for the fhiradmin's password one may set an Environment variable `FHIR_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.\n\n6.  Make sure that your selected database product is running and ready to accept requests as needed:\n    * By default, the FHIR server is installed with the JDBC persistence layer configured to use an Embedded Derby database. When using the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, set the `BOOTSTRAP_DB` environment variable to `true` in order to bootstrap this database. For any other configuration, note the database host and port and, if necessary, create a user with privileges for deploying the schema.\n\n7.  Create and deploy the IBM FHIR Server database schema as needed:\n    * By default, the FHIR server is installed with the JDBC persistence layer configured to use an Embedded Derby database. When using the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, set the `BOOTSTRAP_DB` environment variable to `true` in order to bootstrap this database. For any other configuration, use the `fhir-persistence-schema` module to create and deploy the database schema.\n    * The Db2 persistence layer is always tenant-aware, so you must provision a tenant in addition to deploying the schema. Note the tenant name you provisioned and the tenantKey generated by `fhir-persistence-schema` for the next step.\n\n8.  Configure the `fhir-server-config.json`<sup id=\"a1\">[1](#f1)</sup> configuration file as needed:\n    * By default, the FHIR server is installed with the JDBC persistence layer configured to use a single-tenant Embedded Derby database. For more information, see [Section 3.3 Persistence layer configuration](#33-persistence-layer-configuration).\n\n9.  To start and stop the server, use the Liberty server command:\n```\n    <WLP_HOME>/bin/server start fhir-server\n    <WLP_HOME>/bin/server stop fhir-server\n```\n\n9.  After you start the server, you can verify that it's running properly by invoking the `$healthcheck` endpoint like this:\n\n```\n    curl -k -u '<username>:<password>' 'https://<host>:<port>/fhir-server/api/v4/$healthcheck'\n```\n\nwhere `<username>` is one of the users configured in `server.xml` (default is `fhiruser`).  \nUse single quotes around the URL to prevent $healthcheck from being evaluated as an environment variable on unix-based operating systems.  \n\nOne should see an empty body in the response with a HTTP Response Code 200.\n\nFor more information about the capabilities of the implementation, see [Conformance](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/Conformance).\n\n## 2.2 Upgrading an existing server\nThe IBM FHIR Server does not include an upgrade installer. To upgrade a server to the next version, install the new version to a separate location and copy the configuration files from your existing installation (reconciling any configuration-related changes from the new release in the process).\n\nTo manage database updates over time, the IBM FHIR Server uses custom tools from the `fhir-database-utils` project. Through the use of a metadata table, the database utilities can detect the currently installed version of the database schema and apply any new changes that are needed to bring the database to the current level.\n\nComplete the following steps to upgrade the server:\n\n1. Run the fhir-installer on a separate server.\n2. Configure the new server as appropriate (`fhir-server/server.xml` and anything under the `fhir-server/configDropins`, `fhir-server/config`, and `fhir-server/userlib` directories).\n3. Back up your database.  \n4. Run the migration program (see [Section 3.3.1.1 Supported databases](#3311-supported-databases)).  \n5. Disable traffic to the old server and enable traffic to the new server.\n\n## 2.3 Docker\nThe IBM FHIR Server includes a Docker image [ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server).\n\nNote, logging for the IBM FHIR Server docker image is to stderr and stdout, and is picked up by Logging agents.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server is configured using Environment variables using:\n\n| Environment Variable | Description |\n|----------------------|-------------|\n|`DISABLED_OPERATIONS`|A comma-separated list of operations which are disabled on the IBM FHIR Server, for example, `validate,import`. Note, do not include the dollar sign `$`|\n\n*Development-Only*: If you are using the IBM FHIR Server on a development machine with under 3.25G of RAM. You should download [jvm-dev.options](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/blob/main/fhir-server-webapp/src/main/liberty/config/configDropins/disabled/jvm-dev.options) and mount it when starting the Docker container.  You can use the following pattern for starting up in a restricted test environment (or build your own layer).\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 9443:9443 -e BOOTSTRAP_DB=true \\\n  -v $(pwd)/jvm-dev.options:/config/configDropins/default/jvm.options \\\n  ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server\n```\n\n# 3 Configuration\nThis chapter contains information about the various ways in which the IBM FHIR Server can be configured by users.\n\n## 3.1 Liberty server configuration\nThe IBM FHIR Server is built on the open source [OpenLiberty project](https://openliberty.io/) but also works on the commercial [IBM WebSphere Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty). In documentation and elsewhere, we use `Liberty` to refer to either/or.\n\nAs a Liberty application, the IBM FHIR Server is configurable like any other Liberty server. See https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/server-configuration-overview.html for more information.\n\nBy default, we include:\n* `server.xml` with core server details like the Liberty features, HTTP properties, application info, and a default user registry\n* `jvm.options` with TLS and heap size settings\n* `server.env` with timezone set to UTC\n* `configDropins` with server.xml dropins sorted into `disabled`, `defaults`, and `overrides`\n\n## 3.1.1 Encoded passwords\nIn the examples within the following sections, you'll see the default password `change-password`. In order to secure your server, these values should be changed.\n\nFor example, the basic user registry in the default server.xml defines users `fhiruser` and `fhiradmin` and variables FHIR_USER_PASSWORD and FHIR_ADMIN_PASSWORD, each with a default value of `change-password`.\n\nThese variables can be changed by setting environment variables by the same name.\nAlternatively, users can change the server.xml or use Liberty configDropins to change the values.\n\nOptionally, server.xml values can be encoded via the Liberty `securityUtility` command. For example, to encode a string value with the default `{xor}` encoding, run the following command:\n\n``` sh\n<WLP_HOME>/bin/securityUtility encode stringToEncode\n```\n\nThe output of this command can then be copied and pasted into your `server.xml` or `fhir-server-config.json` file as needed. The `fhir-server-config.json` does not support the securityUtility's `{aes}` encoding at this time, but per the limits to protection through password encryption<sup>[a]</sup>, this encoding does not provide significant additional security beyond `exclusive or` (XOR) encoding.\n\n## 3.1.2 Logging and trace\nThe default server.xml includes variables for configuring the log output:\n```\n    <variable name=\"TRACE_SPEC\" defaultValue=\"*=info\"/>\n    <variable name=\"TRACE_FILE\" defaultValue=\"trace.log\"/>\n    <variable name=\"TRACE_FORMAT\" defaultValue=\"BASIC\"/>\n```\n\nBy default, INFO level messages will go to both the console and a log file at `wlp/usr/servers/fhir-server/logs/messages.log`. For the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, the default is changed to go just to the console.\n\nTo enable tracing, set the TRACE_SPEC variable (e.g. by setting an environment variable by the same name) to a `:`-delimited list of `component = level` pair values. For example, to turn on tracing for the SQL generated by `fhir-persistence-jdbc`, set the TRACE_SPEC to `com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.dao.impl.*=fine:com.ibm.fhir.database.utils.query.QueryUtil=fine`.\n\nBy default, that trace output appears alongside the `messages.log` file in a file named `trace.log`, but the trace output can be sent to the console instead by setting the `TRACE_FILE` variable to `stdout`.\n\nFor more information on logging and tracing in Liberty, see https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/log-trace-configuration.html.\n\n## 3.2 FHIR server configuration\n\n### 3.2.1 Property names\nConfiguration properties stored within a `fhir-server-config.json` file are structured in a hierarchical manner. Here is an example:\n\n```\n    {\n        \"fhirServer\":{\n            \"core\":{\n                \"defaultPrettyPrint\":false\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThroughout this document, we use a path notation to refer to property names. For example, the name of the `defaultPrettyPrint` property in the preceding example would be `fhirServer/core/defaultPrettyPrint`.\n\n### 3.2.2 Tenant-specific configuration properties\nThe IBM FHIR server supports certain multi-tenant features. One such feature is the ability to set certain configuration properties on a per-tenant basis.\n\nIn general, the configuration properties for a particular tenant are stored in the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/<tenant-id>/fhir-server-config.json` file, where `<tenant-id>` refers to the tenant's “short name” or tenant id.\n\nThe global configuration is considered to be associated with a tenant named `default`, so those properties are stored in the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/default/fhir-server-config.json` file.\n\nSimilarly, tenant-specific search parameters are found at `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/<tenant-id>/extension-search-parameters.json`, whereas the global/default extension search parameters are at `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/default/extension-search-parameters.json`.\n\nSearch parameters are handled like a single configuration properly; providing a tenant-specific file will override the global/default extension search parameters as defined at [FHIRSearchConfiguration](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRSearchConfiguration).\n\nMore information about multi-tenant support can be found in [Section 4.9 Multi-tenancy](#49-multi-tenancy).\n\n## 3.3 Persistence layer configuration\nThe IBM FHIR Server allows deployers to select a persistence layer implementation that fits their needs. Currently, the server includes a JDBC persistence layer which supports Apache Derby, IBM Db2, and PostgreSQL.  However, Apache Derby is not recommended for production usage.\n\nBefore you can configure the server to use the JDBC persistence layer implementation, you first need to prepare the database. This step depends on the database product in use and is covered in more detail in [Section 3.3.1.1 Supported databases](#3311-supported-databases).\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server is delivered with a default configuration that is already configured to use the JDBC persistence layer implementation with an Embedded Derby database. This provides the easiest out-of-the-box experience since it requires very little setup.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server persistence configuration is split between `fhir-server-config.json` and the Liberty `server.xml` and `configDropins`.\n\nWithin `fhir-server-config.json`, the value of the `fhirServer/persistence/factoryClassname` is used to instantiate a FHIRPersistence object. By default, the server is configured to use the FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory:\n\n``` json\n    {\n        \"fhirServer\": {\n            …\n            \"persistence\": {\n                \"factoryClassname\": \"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n                …\n            }\n    }\n```\n\n### 3.3.1 The JDBC persistence layer\nWhen the FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory is in use, the `fhirServer/persistence/datasources` property must specify a mapping from datastore-id values to Liberty datasource definitions. For example, here is the configuration for a datastore with id `default` that is configured for the `jdbc/fhir_default_default` datasource of type `postgresql`:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"factoryClassname\":\"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n            \"datasources\": {\n                \"default\": {\n                    \"type\": \"postgresql\",\n                    \"currentSchema\": \"fhirdata\",\n                    \"jndiName\": \"jdbc/fhir_default_default\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBoth the `type` and the `currentSchema` properties are required.\nThe `type` value must be set to one of the supported JDBC types (currently `db2`, `postgresql`, or `derby`) and it must match the actual database type referenced by the datasource definition. If the type does not match, the behavior is undefined.\nBecause the IBM FHIR Server does not quote the schema name in our generated queries, the `currentSchema` property is effectively case-insensitive.\n\nThe `jndiName` property is optional; it will default to `jdbc/fhir_<tenantId>_<dsId>` where `<tenantId>` and `<dsId>` represent the tenant and datastore ids respectively<sup id=\"a4\">[4](#f4)</sup>.\n\nThe datasource definitions themselves are configured in accordance with the [Liberty documentation on Relational database connections with JDBC](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/relational-database-connections-JDBC.html). Previous versions of the IBM FHIR Server supported a proxy datasource that allowed for datasource definitions in the fhir-server-config.json, but now Liberty JDBC datasource configuration is used due to benefits related to configuring pool sizes, transaction recovery, and monitoring.\n\nFor example, the fhir-server-config snippet from above would have a corresponding Liberty config like this:\n```xml\n<server>\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- TENANT: default; DSID: default; TYPE: read-write               -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_default_default\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibPostgres\"/>\n        <properties.postgresql\n             serverName=\"postgres_postgres_1\"\n             portNumber=\"5432\"\n             databaseName=\"fhirdb\"\n             user=\"fhirserver\"\n             password=\"change-password\"\n             currentSchema=\"fhirdata\"\n         />\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"200\" minPoolSize=\"20\"\n            connectionTimeout=\"60s\" maxIdleTime=\"2m\"\n            numConnectionsPerThreadLocal=\"0\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n</server>\n```\n\nDatasource elements should not be defined in the main `server.xml` file but instead should be defined in the `configDropins/overrides` directory. See the [Liberty Profile Server configuration guide](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/server-configuration-overview.html) for more details and general guidance on creating modular configurations.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server is packaged with the following sample datasource definitions at `configDropins/disabled`:\n* datasource-postgresql.xml\n* datasource-db2.xml\n* datasource-derby.xml\n\nThere are 3 libraries defined in the main `server.xml` that reference the required client drivers for each database type:\n* sharedLibDerby\n* sharedLibDb2\n* sharedLibPostgres\n\nWhen a datasource definition is included in a configDropin under `configDropins/overrides`, this file is picked up when the server starts as indicated by the following AUDIT message:\n\n```\n[AUDIT   ] CWWKG0093A: Processing configuration drop-ins resource: <WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/configDropins/overrides/datasource.xml\n```\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server will look up the tenant and datastore id for each request and use the corresponding JNDI name to obtain a connection for the corresponding datasource.\n\n#### 3.3.1.1 Supported databases\n##### Embedded Derby (default)\nIf you are using the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, you can ask the entrypoint script to create (bootstrap) the database and the schema during startup by setting the `BOOTSTRAP_DB` environment variable to `true`.\n\nThis database bootstrap step is only supported for Embedded Derby and will only bootstrap the default datastore of the default tenant (the default for requests with no tenant or datastore headers).\n\n*Reminder*: the Embedded Derby support is designed to support simple getting started scenarios and is not recommended for production use.\n\n``` xml\n<server>\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- This datasource aligns with the Apache Derby database that is  -->\n    <!-- created by the IBM FHIR Server's DB_BOOTSTRAP process.         -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_default_default\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedXADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibDerby\"/>\n        <properties.derby.embedded createDatabase=\"create\" databaseName=\"derby/fhirDB\"/>\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"50\" minPoolSize=\"10\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n</server>\n```\n\n##### Db2\nIf you configure the FHIR server to use an IBM Db2 database, you must:\n\n1. Create the database if it doesn't already exist.\n\n2. Execute the `fhir-persistence-schema` utility to create the necessary schemas (tables, indices, stored procedures, etc) and tenants.\n\n3. Configure the IBM FHIR Server with the tenantKey generated in step number 2.\n\nAn executable `fhir-persistence-schema` jar can be downloaded from the project's [Releases tab](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/releases) and documentation can be found at https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-persistence-schema.\n\nFor a detailed guide on configuring IBM Db2 on Cloud for the IBM FHIR Server, see [DB2OnCloudSetup](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/DB2OnCloudSetup).\n\nSince release 4.3.2 you can use the `search.reopt` query optimizer hint to improve the performance of certain search queries involving multiple search parameters. This optimization is currently only available for Db2. Valid values are \"ALWAYS\" and \"ONCE\". See Db2 documentation for `REOPT` for more details.\n\n##### PostgreSQL\nIf you configure the FHIR server to use a PostgreSQL database, you must:\n\n1. create the database if it doesn't already exist\n\n2. execute the `fhir-persistence-schema` utility with a db-type of `postgresql` to create the necessary schemas (tables, indices, functions, etc)\n\nAn executable `fhir-persistence-schema` jar can be downloaded from the project's [Releases tab](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/releases) and documentation can be found at https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/fhir-persistence-schema.\n\nSince release 4.5.5 you can set the `searchOptimizerOptions/from_collapse_limit` and `searchOptimizerOptions/join_collapse_limit` properties to improve the performance of certain search queries involving multiple search parameters. This optimization is currently only available for PostgreSQL.\n\n##### Other\n\nTo enable the IBM FHIR Server to work with other relational database systems, see\nhttps://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/BringYourOwnPersistence#adding-support-for-another-relational-database\n\n\n#### 3.3.1.2 Datastore configuration examples\nTo understand how the configuration properties are defined for one or more datastores, let's start off with a couple of examples.\n\n##### Example 1\nHere is a simple example of a single (default) Derby datastore.\n\n**config/default/fhir-server-config.json**\n```json\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"factoryClassname\":\"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n            \"datasources\": {\n                \"default\": {\n                    \"type\": \"derby\",\n                    \"currentSchema\": \"APP\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**configDropins/overrides/datasource-derby.xml**\n```xml\n<server>\n    <library id=\"fhirSharedLib\">\n        <fileset dir=\"${shared.resource.dir}/lib/derby\" includes=\"*.jar\"/>\n    </library>\n\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- TENANT: default; DSID: default; TYPE: read-write               -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_default_default\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedXADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibDerby\"/>\n        <properties.derby.embedded createDatabase=\"create\" databaseName=\"derby/fhirDB\"/>\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"50\" minPoolSize=\"10\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n</server>\n```\n\nIn this example, we define an embedded Derby database named `derby/fhirDB` (a location relative to the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server` directory). The datastore-id associated with this datastore is `default`, which is the value that is used if no `X-FHIR-DSID` request header is found in the incoming request. So, when only a single database is being used, it's wise to leverage the `default` datastore-id value to allow REST API consumers to avoid having to set the `X-FHIR-DSID` request header on each request.\n\n##### Example 2\nThis example shows a slightly more complex scenario. In this scenario, the `acme` tenant would like to store data in one of two study-specific Db2 databases with datastore-id values `study1` and `study2`.\n\nFurthermore, the REST API consumers associated with Acme applications will be coded to always set the `X-FHIR-TENANT-ID` request header to be `acme` and the `X-FHIR-DSID` request header to the specific datastore-id associated with each request (either `study1` or `study2`). In this case, the following properties would be configured:\n\n**config/acme/fhir-server-config.json**\n```json\n{\n    \"__comment\":\"Acme's FHIR server configuration\",\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"factoryClassname\":\"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n            \"datasources\": {\n                \"study1\": {\n                    \"tenantKey\": \"<the-tenant-key>\",\n                    \"type\": \"db2\",\n                    \"currentSchema\": \"DB2INST1\"\n                },\n                \"study2\": {\n                    \"tenantKey\": \"<the-tenant-key>\",\n                    \"type\": \"db2\",\n                    \"currentSchema\": \"DB2INST1\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**configDropins/overrides/datasources-acme.xml**\n```xml\n<server>\n    <library id=\"fhirSharedLib\">\n        <fileset dir=\"${shared.resource.dir}/lib/db2\" includes=\"*.jar\"/>\n    </library>\n\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- TENANT: acme; DSID: study1; TYPE: read-write                   -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_acme_study1\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2XADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibDb2\"/>\n        <properties.db2.jcc\n            serverName=\"dbserver1\"\n            portNumber=\"50000\"\n            user=\"db2inst1\"\n            password=\"change-password\"\n            databaseName=\"ACMESTUDY1\"\n            currentSchema=\"DB2INST1\"\n            driverType=\"4\"\n         />\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"200\" minPoolSize=\"20\"\n            connectionTimeout=\"60s\" maxIdleTime=\"2m\"\n            numConnectionsPerThreadLocal=\"0\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <!-- TENANT: acme; DSID: study2; TYPE: read-write                   -->\n    <!-- ============================================================== -->\n    <dataSource id=\"fhirDefaultDefault\" jndiName=\"jdbc/fhir_acme_study2\" type=\"javax.sql.XADataSource\" statementCacheSize=\"200\" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout=\"true\" validationTimeout=\"30s\">\n        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource=\"com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2XADataSource\" libraryRef=\"sharedLibDb2\"/>\n        <properties.db2.jcc\n            serverName=\"dbserver1\"\n            portNumber=\"50000\"\n            user=\"db2inst1\"\n            password=\"change-password\"\n            databaseName=\"ACMESTUDY2\"\n            currentSchema=\"DB2INST1\"\n            driverType=\"4\"\n         />\n        <connectionManager maxPoolSize=\"200\" minPoolSize=\"20\"\n            connectionTimeout=\"60s\" maxIdleTime=\"2m\"\n            numConnectionsPerThreadLocal=\"0\"/>\n    </dataSource>\n</server>\n```\n\nNote that because this example is using the default FHIR server naming scheme for datasource JNDI names, there is no need to include the 'jndiName' property in the fhir-server-config.json, although you can specify it should you wish to make the mapping clear.\n\nAdditionally, note that each datasource definition in the configDropin gets its own connection pool with properties defined by the 'connectionManager' element.\n\n#### 3.3.1.3 Database Access TransactionManager Timeout\nThe TransactionManager controls the timeout of database queries.  \n\nTo modify the default transaction timeout value, set the environment variable `FHIR_TRANSACTION_MANAGER_TIMEOUT` or enter the value in the server.env file at the root of the WLP fhir-server instance. Example values are `120s` (seconds) or `2m` (minutes).\n\n## 3.4 “Update/Create” feature\nNormally, the _update_ operation is invoked with a FHIR resource which represents a new version of an existing resource. The resource specified in the _update_ operation would contain the same id of that existing resource. If a resource containing a non-existent id were specified in the _update_ invocation, an error would result.\n\nThe FHIR specification defines optional behavior for the _update_ operation where it can create a new resource if a non-existent resource is specified in the invocation. The FHIR server supports this optional behavior via the `fhirServer/persistence/common/updateCreateEnabled` configuration parameter. If this configuration parameter is set to `true` (the default), then the _update_ operation will create a new resource if it is invoked with a resource containing a non-existent id. If the option is set to false, then the optional behavior is disabled and an error would be returned.\n\nThe following example shows the JSON for enabling _update_ operations to create resources:\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"common\":{\n                \"updateCreateEnabled\":true\n            }\n        }\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# 4 Customization\nYou can modify the default server implementation by taking advantage of the IBM FHIR server's extensibility. The following extension points are available:\n * Custom operations framework:  The IBM FHIR Server defines an operations framework that builds on the FHIR OperationDefinition resource in order to extend the FHIR REST API with custom endpoints.\n * Pluggable audit service:  Logging and auditing options including Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) over Apache Kafka.\n * Persistence interceptors:  Intercept requests before and/or after each persistence action.\n * Resource validation:  FHIRPath-based validation of FHIR resources on create or update with the ability to extend the system with custom constraints.\n\n## 4.1 Extended operations\nIn addition to the standard REST API (create, update, search, and so forth), the IBM FHIR Server supports the [FHIR operations framework](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/operations.html).\n\n### 4.1.1 Packaged operations\nThe FHIR team provides implementations for the standard `$validate`, `$document`, `$everything`, `$expand`, `$lookup`, `$subsumes`, `$closure`, `$export`, `$import`, `$convert`, `$apply` and `$translate` operations, as well as a custom operation named `$healthcheck`, which queries the configured persistence layer to report its health.\n\nThe server also bundles `$reindex` to reindex instances of Resources so they are searchable, `$retrieve-index` to retrieve lists of resources available to be reindexed, and `$erase` to hard delete instances of Resources. To learn more about the $erase operation, read the [design document](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/operation/fhir-operation-erase/README.md).\n\nTo extend the server with additional operations, see [Section 4.1.2 Custom operations](#412-custom-operations)\n\n#### 4.1.1.1 $validate\nThe `$validate` operation checks whether the attached content would be acceptable either generally, or as a create, update, or delete against an existing resource instance or type. By default, the `$validate` operation will validate a resource against the base specification and any profiles asserted in its `Resource.meta.profile` element. The default behavior may be changed in one of the following ways:\n* If a profile is specified via the optional `profile` parameter, the $validate operation will validate a resource against the base specification and the specified profile only. It will not validate against any other profiles asserted in the `Resource.meta.profile` element.\n* If the `profile` parameter is not specified, but the `mode` parameter is specified, and the `mode` parameter value is either `create` or `update`, the $validate operation will validate a resource against the base specification and any profiles asserted in its `Resource.meta.profile` element, but will do so based on profile configuration properties specified in the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles` section of the `fhir-server-config.json` file (see the [Configuration properties reference](#51-configuration-properties-reference) for configuration details).\n\nhttps://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/resource-operation-validate.html\n\n#### 4.1.1.2 $healthcheck\nThe `$healthcheck` operation returns the health of the FHIR server and its datastore. In the default JDBC persistence layer, this operation creates a connection to the configured database and return its status. The operations returns `200 OK` when healthy. Otherwise, it returns an HTTP error code and an `OperationOutcome` with one or more issues.\n\n### 4.1.2 Custom operations\nIn addition to the provided operations, the FHIR server supports user-provided custom operations through a Java Service Provider Interface (SPI).\n\nTo contribute an operation:\n1. Implement each operation as a Java class that extends `com.ibm.fhir.operation.AbstractOperation` from `fhir-operation.jar`. Ensure that your implementation returns an appropriate `OperationDefinition` in its `getDefinition()` method, because the framework validates both the request and response payloads to ensure that they conform to the definition.\n\n2. Create a file named `com.ibm.fhir.operation.FHIROperation` with one or more fully qualified `FHIROperation` classnames and package it in your jar under `META-INF/services/`.\n\n3. Include your jar file under the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/userlib/` directory of your installation.\n\n4. Restart the FHIR server. Changes to custom operations require a server restart, because the server discovers and instantiates operations during server startup only.\n\nAfter you register your operation with the server, it is available via HTTP POST at `[base]/api/1/$<yourCode>`, where `<yourCode>` is the value of your OperationDefinition's [code](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/operationdefinition-definitions.html#OperationDefinition.code).\n\n## 4.2 Notification Service\nThe FHIR server provides a notification service that publishes notifications about persistence events, specifically _create_, _update_, and _delete_ operations. The notification service can be used by other components to trigger specific actions that need to occur as resources are being updated in the FHIR server datastore.\n\nThe notification service supports two implementations: WebSocket and Kafka.\n\n### 4.2.1 FHIRNotificationEvent\nThe `FHIRNotificationEvent` class defines the information that is published by the notification service. Each notification event published to the WebSocket or Kafka topic is an instance of `FHIRNotificationEvent`, serialized as a JSON object. This JSON object will have the following fields:\n\nField name     | Type   | Description\n|--------------| -----  | ------------|\n`operationType`| String | The operation associated with the notification event. Valid values are _create_ and _update_.\n`location`     | String | The location URI of the resource associated with the notification event. To retrieve this resource, invoke a GET request using the location URI value as the URL string.\n`lastUpdated`  | String | The date and time of the last update made to the resource associated with the notification event.\n`resourceId`   | String | The logical id of the resource associated with the notification event.\n`resource`     | String | A stringified JSON object which is the resource associated with the notification event.\n`tenantId`     | String | The tenant that generated this notification\n`datasourceId` | String | The datasource used by the tenant\n\nThe following JSON is an example of a serialized notification event:\n\n```\n{\n  \"lastUpdated\":\"2016-06-01T10:36:23.232-05:00\",\n  \"location\":\"Observation/3859/_history/1\",\n  \"operationType\":\"create\",\n  \"resourceId\":\"3859\",\n  \"tenantId\":\"default\",\n  \"datasourceId\":\"default\",\n  \"resource\":{ …<contents of resource>… }\n}\n```\n\nIf the resource is over the limit specified in `fhirServer/notifications/common/maxNotificationSizeBytes`, the default value is to subset `id`, `meta`, `resourceType`, and all Resource required fields and add the subset to the FHIRNotificationEvent. In alternative configurations, user may set `fhirServer/notifications/common/maxNotificationSizeBehavior` to `omit` and subsequently retrieve the resource using the location.\n\n### 4.2.2 WebSocket\nThe WebSocket implementation of the notification service will publish notification event messages to a WebSocket. To enable WebSocket notifications, set the `fhirServer/notifications/websocket/enabled` property to `true`, as in the following example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"notifications\":{\n            …\n            \"websocket\":{\n                \"enabled\":true\n            }\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe WebSocket location URI is `ws://<host>:<port>/fhir-server/api/v4/notification`, where `<host>` and `<port>` represent the host and port of the FHIR server's REST API endpoint. So for example, if the FHIR server endpoint's base URL is `https://localhost:9443/fhir-server/api/v4` then the corresponding location of the WebSocket would be `ws://localhost:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/notification`.\n\n### 4.2.3 Kafka\nThe Kafka implementation of the notification service will publish notification event messages to a Kafka topic. To configure the Kafka notification publisher, configure properties in the `fhir-server-config.json` file as indicated in the following example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"notifications\":{\n            …\n            \"kafka\":{\n                \"enabled\":true,\n                \"topicName\":\"fhirNotifications\",\n                \"connectionProperties\":{\n                    \"group.id\":\"securing-kafka-group\",\n                    \"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9093\",\n                    \"security.protocol\":\"SSL\",\n                    \"ssl.truststore.location\":\"resources/security/kafka.client.truststore.jks\",\n                    \"ssl.truststore.password\":\"change-password\",\n                    \"ssl.keystore.location\":\"resources/security/kafka.client.keystore.jks\",\n                    \"ssl.keystore.password\":\"change-password\",\n                    \"ssl.key.password\":\"change-password\",\n                    \"ssl.truststore.type\":\"JKS\",\n                    \"ssl.keystore.type\":\"JKS\"\n                }\n            }\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `fhirServer/notifications/kafka/enabled` property is used to enable or disable the Kafka publisher component.\n\nThe `fhirServer/notifications/kafka/topicName` property is used to configure the appropriate topic name to which the notification events should be published.\n\nThe `fhirServer/notifications/kafka/connectionProperties` property group is used to configure the properties necessary to successfully connect to the Kafka server. You can specify an arbitrary `group.id`. The `bootstrap.servers` property is required, but the rest are optional, although if your Kafka server is configured to require an SSL connection and client authentication, then the remaining properties must also be set. For more details about Kafka-related properties, see the Kafka documentation.\n\nIn the `connectionProperties` property group in preceding example, you'll notice that the password-related properties have encoded values. To store a value requiring security (such as a password), you can use Liberty's `securityUtility` command to encode the value. See [Section 3.1 Encoded passwords](#31-encoded-passwords) for details.\n\nBefore you enable Kafka notifications, it's important to understand the topology of the environment in which the FHIR server instance will be running. Your topic name selection should be done in consideration of the topology. If you have multiple instances of the FHIR server clustered together to form a single logical endpoint, then each of those instances should be configured to use the same Kafka topic for notifications. This is so that notification consumers (subscribers) can subscribe to a single topic and receive all the notifications published by each of the FHIR server instances within the cluster.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have two completely independent FHIR server instances, then you should configure each one with its own topic name.\n\nThe FHIRNotificationEvent is asynchronous by default. If you want to specify a synchronous request, you can set `fhirServer/notifications/kafka/sync` to true, which ensures no message is lost in publishing, however it does add latency in each request.\n\n### 4.2.3 NATS\nThe [NATS](http://nats.io) implementation of the notification service publishes notification event messages to a NATS streaming cluster. To configure the NATS notification publisher, configure properties in the `fhir-server-config.json` file as shown in the following example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        ...\n        \"notifications\":{\n            ...\n            \"nats\": {\n\t\t        \"enabled\": true,\n\t\t        \"cluster\": \"nats-streaming\",\n\t\t        \"channel\": \"fhirNotifications\",\n\t\t        \"clientId\": \"fhir-server\",\n\t\t        \"servers\": \"nats://nats-node1:4222,nats://nats-node2:4222,nats://nats-node3:4222\",\n\t\t        \"useTLS\": true,\n\t\t        \"truststoreLocation\": \"resources/security/nats.client.truststore.p12\",\n\t\t        \"truststorePassword\": \"change-password\",\n\t\t        \"keystoreLocation\": \"resources/security/nats.client.keystore.p12\",\n\t\t        \"keystorePassword\": \"change-password\"\n    }\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSet the `fhirServer/notifications/nats/enabled` property to true and provide the name of your NATS cluster for the value of `fhirServer/notifications/nats/cluster`.  You may leave `fhirServer/notifications/nats/channel` and `fhirServer/notifications/nats/clientId` as defined.  Provide the URL for one or more NATS servers as the value for `fhirServer/notifications/nats/servers`.\n\nTo use TLS to connect to your NATS cluster, set `fhirServer/notifications/nats/useTLS` to true and provide client truststore and keystore locations and passwords as the remaining config values. Ensure that your NATS cluster is configured for TLS client connections.\n\nTo store a value requiring security, such as a password, use Liberty's `securityUtility` command to encode the value. See Section 3.1 Encoded passwords for details.\n\n### 4.2.4 Resource type filtering\nBy default, notification messages are published for all _create_ and _update_ persistence operations. However, the FHIR server allows you to configure a list of resource types for which notification events will be published. To do this, list the resource types for which you want to generate notifications in an array of strings within the  `fhirServer/notifications/common/includeResourceTypes` property in the `fhir-server-config.json` file, as in the following example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"notifications\":{\n            …\n            \"common\":{\n                \"includeResourceTypes\":[\n                     \"Observation\",\n                     \"Patient\"\n                ]\n            },\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith the `includeResourceTypes`property set as in the preceding example, the FHIR server publishes notification events only for `Patient` and `Observation` resources. If you omit this property or set its value to `[]` (an empty array), then the FHIR server publishes notifications for all resource types.\n\n## 4.3 Persistence interceptors\nThe IBM FHIR Server supports a persistence interceptor feature that enables users to add their own logic to the REST API processing flow around persistence events. This can be used to enforce application-specific business rules associated with resources. Interceptor methods are called immediately before or after each persistence operation.\n\n### 4.3.1 FHIRPersistenceInterceptor interface\nA persistence interceptor implementation must implement the `com.ibm.fhir.server.spi.interceptor.FHIRPersistenceInterceptor` interface.\n\nEach interceptor method receives a parameter of type `FHIRPersistenceEvent`, which contains context information related to the request being processed at the time that the interceptor method is invoked. It includes the FHIR resource, security information, request URI information, and the collection of HTTP headers associated with the request.\n\nThere are many use cases for persistence interceptors:\n\n1.  Enforce certain application-specific governance rules, such as making sure that a patient has signed a consent form prior to allowing his/her data to be persisted. For example, the `beforeCreate` and `beforeUpdate` methods could verify that the patient has a consent agreement on file and, if not, then throw a `FHIRPersistenceInterceptorException` to prevent the _create_ or _update_ events from completing. The exception thrown by the interceptor method should include one or more OperationOutcome issues and these issues will be added to an `OperationOutcome` in the REST API response. The HTTP status code of the response will be determined by the IssueType of the first issue in the list.\n\n2.  Perform additional access control. For example, `beforeSearch` can be used to alter the incoming SearchContext (e.g. by adding additional search parameters). Similarly `afterRead`, `afterVRead`, `afterHistory`, and `afterSearch` can be used to verify that the end user is authorized to access the resources before they are returned.\n\nIt is also possible to modify the incoming resources from the `beforeCreate` and `beforeUpdate` methods. For example, an interceptor could be used to add tags to resources on their way into the server. However, it is important to realize that interceptors are called *after* resource validation. Therefore, interceptor authors must be careful not to alter the resources in a way that breaks conformance with the profiles claimed in Resource.meta.profile or the secondary constraints in the specification. When in doubt, interceptors that modify the incoming resource can use the FHIRValidator to re-validate the resource(s) after they are altered.\n\n### 4.3.2 Implementing a persistence interceptor\nTo implement a persistence interceptor, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Develop a Java class which implements the `FHIRPersistenceInterceptor` interface.\n2.  Store the fully-qualified classname of your interceptor implementation class in a file called :\n\n      `META-INF/services/com.ibm.fhir.server.spi.interceptor.FHIRPersistenceInterceptor`\n\n    Here's an example of the file contents:\n\n    `com.ibm.mysolution.MyInterceptor`\n\n3.  Copy your jar to the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/userlib` directory so that it is accessible to the FHIR server via the classpath (the `server.xml` file contains a library element that defines this directory as a shared library).\n\n4.  Re-start the FHIR server.\n\n## 4.4 Registry resources\nThe IBM FHIR Server includes a dynamic registry of conformance resources.\nThe server pre-packages conformance artifacts from [HL7 FHIR version 4.3.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/downloads.html)\nand uses a Java ServiceLoader to discover additional registry resource providers on the classpath.\n\nThe server consults this registry for:\n* StructureDefinition, ValueSet, and CodeSystem resources for resource validation.\n* SearchParameter and CompartmentDefinition resources for search.\n* ValueSet and CodeSystem resources for terminology operations.\n* And more.\n\nOne common technique for extending FHIR with a set of conformance resources is to build or reference an [Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/implementationguide.html).\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server includes a [PackageRegistryResourceProvider](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide#making-profiles-available-to-the-fhir-registry-component-fhirregistry) for registering implementation guide resources.\n\nAdditionally, we [pre-package a number of popular implementation guides](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide#optional-profile-support) and make those available from both our GitHub Releases and [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/ibm/fhir/).\n\nFinally, the IBM FHIR Server includes a built-in ServerRegistryResourceProvider that can be used to bridge conformance resources from the tenant data store (uploaded through the REST API) to the registry.\nThis provider can be enabled/disabled via the `fhirServer/core/serverRegistryResourceProviderEnabled` property, but we recommend leaving it disabled for performance-intensive workloads.\n\n## 4.5 Resource validation\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the IBM FHIR Server registry is consulted during resource validation.\n\n### 4.5.1 HL7 spec-defined validation support\nThe FHIR specification provides a number of different validation resources including:\n\n1.  XML Schemas\n2.  ISO XML Schematron rules\n3.  Structure Definitions / Profiles for standard resource types, data types and built-in value sets\n\nThe FHIR server validates incoming resources for create and update interactions using the resource definitions and their corresponding FHIRPath constraints. Additionally, the FHIR server provides the [$validate](#411-packaged-operations) operation that API consumers can use to POST resources and get validation feedback:\n```\nPOST <base>/<resourceType>/$validate\n```\n\n### 4.5.2 Extension validation\nFHIR resources can be extended. Each extension has a url and servers can use these urls to validate the contents of the extension.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server performs extension validation by looking up the extension definition in its internal registry.\nIf an instance contains extensions that are unknown to the server, then the server will include a validation warning that indicates this extension could not be validated.\n\n### 4.5.3 Profile validation\nThe IBM FHIR Server can be extended with custom profile validation. This allows one to apply validation rules on the basis of the `Resource.meta.profile` values included on the resource instance.\n\nFor example, you can configure a set of FHIRPath Constraints to run for resources that claim conformance to the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partner` profile when you see an input resource like the following:\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Patient\",\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"profile\": [ \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partner\" ]\n    },\n    \"name\" : [ {\n        \"family\" : [ \"Doe\" ],\n        \"given\" : [ \"John\" ]\n    } ],\n    \"telecom\" : [ {\n        \"value\" : \"555-1234\",\n        \"system\": \"phone\",\n        \"use\" : \"home\"\n    } ],\n    \"birthDate\" : \"1950-08-15\"\n}\n```\n\nThe following configuration parameters can be used to specify rules relating to the set of profiles that are specified in a resource's `meta.profile` element:\n* `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/atLeastOne` - to specify a set of profiles, at least one of which a resource must claim conformance to and be successfully validated against in order to be persisted to the FHIR server.\n* `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/notAllowed` - to specify a set of profiles to which a resource is *not allowed* to claim conformance.\n* `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/allowUnknown` - to indicate whether a warning or an error is issued if a profile specified in a resource's `meta.profile` element is not loaded in the FHIR server. The default value is `true`, meaning unknown profiles are allowed to be specified. The profile will be ignored and just a warning will be returned. If set to `false`, this means unknown profiles are not allowed to be specified. An error will be returned and resource validation will fail.\n* `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/defaultVersions` - to specify which version of a profile will be used during resource validation if the profile specified in a resource's `meta.profile` element does not contain a version. If a default profile version is not configured using this configuration parameter for an asserted profile, the FHIR server will determine the default version to use for validation.\n\nBefore calling the FHIR validator to validate a resource against the set of profiles specified in its `meta.profile` element that it is claiming conformance to, the following pre-validation will be performed for that set of profiles based on the configuration parameters listed above:\n1. If any specified profile does not contain a version, and that profile is in the set of profiles configured to have a default version via the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/defaultVersions` configuration parameter, the default version for that profile will be appended to the profile name, and it is this new profile name containing the version which will be evaluated against in the following steps.\n2. If the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/notAllowed` configuration parameter is set to a non-empty list, an error will be returned for any specified profile that is in the list, and validation will fail.\n3. If the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/allowUnknown` configuration parameter is set to `false`,  an error will be returned for any specified profile that is not loaded in the FHIR server, and validation will fail.\n4. If the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/atLeastOne` configuration parameter is set to a non-empty list, an error will be returned if none of the specified profiles is in the list, and validation will fail.\n\nIf the resource passes pre-validation successfully, it will then be passed to the FHIR validator to validate conformance to the specified set of profiles.\n\nThe following example configuration shows how to define these configuration parameters:\n```\n{\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        …\n        \"resources\":{\n            \"open\": true,\n            \"Observation\": {\n                \"profiles\": {\n                    \"atLeastOne\": [\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerB|1.0\"\n                    ],\n                    \"allowUnknown\": false,\n                    \"defaultVersions\": {\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA\": \"1.1\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerE\": \"2.0\"\n                    }\n                }\n            },\n            \"Patient\": {\n                \"profiles\": {\n                    \"notAllowed\": [\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerC\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerD|2.0\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"Resource\": {\n                \"profiles\": {\n                    \"notAllowed\": [\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerF\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerG|4.0.0\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerH\"\n                    ],\n                    \"defaultVersions\": {\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerI\": \"1.0\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerJ\": \"3.1.1\",\n                        \"http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerK\": \"1.1\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        …\n    }\n}\n```\n\nGiven this configuration, in order for an `Observation` resource to be persisted to the FHIR server:\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element must specify either the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA` profile or the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerB|1.0` profile or both, based on the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/atLeastOne` list. Other profiles may be specified as well assuming they pass the following checks.\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element must not specify any profile which is specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles/notAllowed` list. Since the `notAllowed` property is not specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles` section, it is inherited from the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles` section if specified there.\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element must not specify any profile which is not loaded in the FHIR server, based on the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/allowUnknown` value of `false`.\n* The resource must successfully validate against all specified profiles. Note that if the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA` profile is specified, what is actually evaluated against and eventually passed to the FHIR validator is `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA|1.1`. This is because the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA` profile is specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/defaultVersions` set with a default version of `1.1`.\n\nIn order for a `Patient` resource to be persisted to the FHIR server:\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element is not required to specify any profile since the `atLeastOne` property is not specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Patient/profiles` section, nor is it specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles` section, where the property would be inherited from if specified. Any valid `Patient` profile may be specified assuming it passes the following checks.\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element cannot specify either the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerC` profile or the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerD|2.0` profile, based on the `fhirServer/resources/Patient/profiles/notAllowed` list.\n* The resource's `meta.profile` element may specify a profile which is not loaded in the FHIR server. Based on the absence of the `allowUnknown` property in the `fhirServer/resources/Patient/profiles` section, as well as the absence of that property in the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles` section (where the property would be inherited from if specified), the default value of `true` is used. This means unknown profiles (not loaded in the FHIR server) will be allowed and will simply be ignored.\n* The resource must successfully validate against all specified profiles. Note that since the `defaultVersions` property is not specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Patient/profiles` section, this property will be inherited from the `fhirServer/resources/Resource/profiles/defaultVersions` property. So if a profile is specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element that is in the set of `defaultVersions` profiles, what will actually be evaluated against and eventually passed to the FHIR validator is the original profile name with its specified default version appended to it.\n\nIf a profile in either the list specified by the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/atLeastOne` configuration parameter or the list specified by the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/notAllowed` configuration parameter contains a version, for example `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partner|1.0`, then a profile of the same name specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element will only be considered a match if it contains exactly the same version. However, if a profile in the lists specified by the configuration parameters does not contain a version, for example `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partner`, then a profile of the same name specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element will be considered a match whether it contains a version or not.\n\nKeep in mind that a profile name specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element could be modified due to the resource's `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/profiles/defaultVersions` configuration. It is this modified profile name that is used in the matching process and in the resource's validation, but only for those purposes. The `meta.profile` element of the original resource itself is not updated with the modified profile name.\n\nUsing the example configuration above for the `Observation` resource type, if the profile `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA|3.2` was specified in a resource's `meta.profile` element then it would be considered a match for the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerA` profile specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/atLeastOne` list. Conversely, if the profile `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerB` was specified in the resource's `meta.profile` element then it would *not* be considered a match for the `http://ibm.com/fhir/profile/partnerB|1.0` profile specified in the `fhirServer/resources/Observation/profiles/atLeastOne` list.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server pre-packages all conformance resources from the core specification.\n\nSee [Validation Guide - Optional profile support](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide#optional-profile-support) for a list of pre-built Implementation Guide resources and how to load them into the IBM FHIR server.\n\nSee [Validation Guide - Making profiles available to the fhir registry](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide#making-profiles-available-to-the-fhir-registry-component-fhirregistry) for information about how to extend the server with additional Implementation Guide artifacts.\n\n\n## 4.6 Extending search\nIn addition to supporting tenant-specific search parameter extensions as described in [Section 3.2.2 Tenant-specific configuration properties](#322-tenant-specific-configuration-properties), the IBM FHIR Server also supports loading\nsearch parameters from the registry.\n\nFor performance reasons, the registry search parameters are retrieved once and only once during startup.\n\nThe set of search parameters can filtered / refined via `fhirServer/resources/[resourceType]/searchParameters` as described in the [Search configuration guide](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRSearchConfiguration#13-filtering).\n\n## 4.7 FHIR client API\n\n### 4.7.1 Overview\nIn addition to the server, we also offer a Java API for invoking FHIR REST APIs. The IBM FHIR Client is built on JAX-RS 2.1 and provides a simple properties-driven client that can be configured for a given endpoint, mutual authentication, request/response logging, and more.\n\n### 4.7.2 Maven coordinates\nTo use the FHIR Client from your application, specify the `fhir-client` artifact as a dependency within your `pom.xml` file, as in the following example:\n\n```\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>com.ibm.fhir</groupId>\n            <artifactId>fhir-client</artifactId>\n            <version>${fhir.client.version}</version>\n        </dependency>\n```\n\n### 4.7.3 Client properties\nApplicable client properties are documented in the FHIRClient interface.\nBelow is a summary of the most pertinent ones:\n\n| Property | Default | Description |\n| -------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| fhirclient.rest.base.url<sup>*</sup> | | The target FHIR Server's [base URL](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#root) |\n| fhirclient.default.mimetype | application/fhir+json; fhirVersion=4.3 | The value to use in the HTTP headers (Accept and Content-Type) passed to the FHIR Server. |\n| fhirclient.truststore.location | | The client truststore's filename. The client truststore contains the server's public key certificates and is used to verify the server's identity. |\n| fhirclient.truststore.password | | The client truststore's password. |\n| fhirclient.hostnameVerification.enabled | true | Indicates whether or not to enable hostname verification when connecting over TLS. |\n| fhirclient.basicauth.enabled | false | Indicates whether Basic Authentication should be used. If enabled, then the username and password properties are required. |\n| fhirclient.basicauth.username | | The username to use with Basic Authentication. |\n| fhirclient.basicauth.password | | The password to use with Basic Authentication. |\n| fhirclient.clientauth.enabled | false | Indicates whether mutual TLS certificate-based authentication should be used. If enabled, then keystore properties are required. |\n| fhirclient.keystore.location | | The client keystore's filename. The client keystore constains the client's public/private key pair. When using client certificate-based authentication, this is now the client supplies its identity to the server|\n| fhirclient.keystore.password | | The client keystore's password. |\n| fhirclient.keystore.key.password | | The password associated with the client's certificate within the keystore. |\n| fhirclient.logging.enabled | false | Whether to enable request/response logging (useful for debug). |\n| fhirclient.http.receive.timeout | 130000 (130 seconds) | The time, in seconds, to wait for a server response. |\n\n### 4.7.4 Sample usage\nFor examples on how to use the IBM FHIR Client, look for tests like `com.ibm.fhir.client.test.mains.FHIRClientSample` from the `fhir-client` project in git. Additionally, the FHIR Client is heavilly used from our integration tests in `fhir-server-test`.\n\n## 4.8 Using local references within request bundles\nInter-dependencies between resources are typically defined by one resource containing a field of type `Reference` which contains an _external reference_<sup id=\"a5\">[5](#f5)</sup> to another resource. For example, an `Observation` resource could reference a `Patient` resource via the Observation's `subject` field. The value that is stored in the `Reference.reference` field (for example, `Observation.subject.reference` in the case of the `Observation` resource) could be an absolute URL, such as `https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/12345`, or a relative URL, such as `Patient/12345`.\n\nAs described above, in order to establish a reference to a resource, you must first know its resource identifier. However, if you are using a request bundle to create both the referenced resource (`Patient` in this example) and the resource which references it (`Observation`), then it is impossible to know the `Patient`resource identifier before the request bundle has been processed (that is, before the new `Patient` resource is created).\n\nThankfully, the HL7 FHIR specification defines a way to express a dependency between two resources within a request bundle by using a _local identifier_ to identify the resource being referenced, and a _local reference_<sup id=\"a6\">[6](#f6)</sup> to reference the resource via its local identifier. In the following example, a request bundle contains a `POST` request to create a new `Patient` resource, along with a `POST` request to create a new `Observation` resource that references that `Patient`:\n\n<a id=\"example-obs-ref-pat\"></a>\n\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\": \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\": \"batch\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"urn:uuid:7113a0bb-d9e0-49df-9855-887409388c69\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Patient\",\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Patient\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Observation\",\n            …\n            \"subject\" : {\n                \"reference\" : \"urn:uuid:7113a0bb-d9e0-49df-9855-887409388c69\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Observation\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nTo define a local identifier for a resource, you must specify it in the `Bundle.entry.fullUrl` field of the resource's bundle entry. The HL7 FHIR specification recommends that the local identifier be the persistent identity of the resource if known, otherwise a UUID value prefixed with `urn:uuid:` as in the preceding example. However, the FHIR server does not require the use of a UUID value. You can use any `fullUrl` value you like as long as it is unique within the bundle. For example, you can use `urn:Patient_1`, `urn:ABC`, or `urn:Foo`.\n\nAfter you define a local identifier for the referenced resource, you can then define one or more references to that resource by using the local identifier instead of an external identifier. In the preceding example, you can see that the Observation's `subject.reference` field specifies the Patient's local identifier as specified in the `fullUrl` field of the Patient's request entry.\n\n### 4.8.1 Processing rules\nThe following processing rules apply for the use of local references within a request bundle:\n1.  A local identifier must be defined via a request bundle entry's `fullUrl` field in order for that local identifier to be used in a local reference.\n2.  Local references will only be recognized for local identifiers associated with request bundle entries with a request method of `POST` or `PUT`.\n3.  `POST` requests will be processed before `PUT` requests.\n4.  <a id=\"order-dependency-rule\"></a>There is no order dependency within a request bundle for bundle entries defining local identifiers and bundle entries which reference those local identifiers via local references.\n5.  <a id=\"relative-reference-rule\"></a>If a resource in a request bundle entry contains a field of type `Reference` having a value which is a relative URL, and if that bundle entry has a local identifier (`fullUrl`) which is an absolute URL conforming to the FHIR specification's [RESTful URL definition](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/references.html#regex), then the FHIR server will attempt to resolve the local reference as follows, based on the [FHIR specification](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/bundle.html#references):\n    - it will extract the FHIR base URL from the local identifier and append the local reference to it\n    - it will then try to resolve the reference within the request bundle using the updated local reference\n\n    See the [relative local reference example](#example-ref-via-relative-local-ref) below for an illustration of this rule.\n\nIn the [example above](#example-obs-ref-pat), you can see that there are two POST requests and the `Patient` request entry appears in the bundle before the `Observation` request entry. However, based on the [order dependency processing rule](#order-dependency-rule), it would still be a valid request bundle even if the `Observation` request entry appeared before the `Patient` request entry.\n\nThe following examples also satisfy the local reference processing rules:\n\n#### Example: Circular references\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\" : \"batch\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"urn:Encounter_1\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Encounter\",\n            …\n            \"reasonReference\" : [ {\n                    \"reference\" : \"urn:Procedure_1\"\n            } ],\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Encounter\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"urn:Procedure_1\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Procedure\",\n            …\n            \"encounter\" : {\n                    \"reference\" : \"urn:Encounter_1\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Procedure\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nWhile processing a request bundle, but before processing individual request entries, the IBM FHIR server detects the use of a local identifier within any `POST` or `PUT` request entry's `fullUrl` field, and establishes a mapping between that local identifier and the corresponding external identifier that results from performing the `POST` or `PUT` operation.\n\nUsing the circular reference example above, the FHIR server detects the use of local identifiers in the `Encounter` request entry (`urn:Encounter_1`) and in the `Procedure` request entry (`urn:Procedure_1`), and establishes a mapping between the local identifiers and the external references to be associated with the new `Encounter` and `Procedure` resources (for example, `Encounter/1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b` and `Procedure/22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf`).\n\nThen when the FHIR server processes the POST requests for the `Encounter` and `Procedure` resources, it detects the use of the local references and substitutes the corresponding external references for them before creating the new resources. Below is the response bundle for the request bundle in the circular references example. We can see that the Encounter's `reasonReference.reference` field now contains a proper external reference to the newly-created `Procedure` resource, and the Procedure's `encounter.reference` field now contains a proper external reference to the newly-created `Encounter` resource:\n\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\" : \"batch-response\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Encounter\",\n            \"id\" : \"1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b\",\n            …\n            \"reasonReference\" : [ {\n                    \"reference\" : \"Procedure/22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf\"\n            } ],\n            …\n        },\n        \"response\" : {\n            \"id\" : \"1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b\",\n            \"status\" : \"201\",\n            \"location\" : \"Encounter/1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b/_history/1\",\n            \"etag\" : \"W/\\\"1\\\"\",\n            \"lastModified\" : \"2017-03-01T20:56:59.540Z\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Procedure\",\n            \"id\" : \"22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf\",\n            …\n            \"encounter\" : {\n                \"reference\" : \"Encounter/1cc5d299-d2be-4f93-8745-a121232ffe5b\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"response\" : {\n            \"id\" : \"22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf\",\n            \"status\" : \"201\",\n            \"location\" : \"Procedure/22b21fcf-8d00-492d-9de0-e25ddd409eaf/_history/1\",\n            \"etag\" : \"W/\\\"1\\\"\",\n            \"lastModified\" : \"2017-03-01T20:56:59.652Z\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Reference to entry with conditional create\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\" : \"batch\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Observation\",\n            \"id\" : \"25b1fe08-7612-45eb-af80-7e15d9806b2b\",\n            …\n            \"subject\" : {\n                    \"reference\" : \"urn:Patient_1\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"PUT\",\n            \"url\" : \"Observation/25b1fe08-7612-45eb-af80-7e15d9806b2b\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"urn:Patient_1\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Patient\",\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Patient\",\n            \"ifNoneExist\": \"identifier=http://my-system|123\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, even though the `Patient` request entry is a conditional create request, this is still a valid request bundle, because the FHIR server resolves any conditional requests before it establishes the mapping between local identifiers and the corresponding external identifiers that will result from performing the `POST` or `PUT` operation.\n\n#### <a id=\"example-ref-via-relative-local-ref\"></a>Example: Reference via relative local reference\n```\n{\n    \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\" : \"batch\",\n    \"entry\" : [ {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/new\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Patient\",\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Patient\"\n        }\n    }, {\n        \"fullUrl\" : \"https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Observation/new\",\n        \"resource\" : {\n            \"resourceType\" : \"Observation\",\n            …\n            \"subject\" : {\n                \"reference\" : \"Patient/new\"\n            },\n            …\n        },\n        \"request\" : {\n            \"method\" : \"POST\",\n            \"url\" : \"Observation\"\n        }\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we demonstrate the [relative reference processing rule](#relative-reference-rule). The local identifiers for the request bundle entries (`https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/new` and `https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Observation/new`) are absolute URLs that conform to the FHIR specification's [RESTful URL definition](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/references.html#regex) . When the FHIR server attempts to resolve the `Observation` request entry's `subject` reference (`Patient/new`), it will apply the processing rule for relative references, since the reference is a relative URL. The `subject` reference will be modified to be the original local reference (`Patient/new`) appended to the FHIR base URL extracted from the `Observation` entry's local identifier (`https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/`). The resulting local reference  (`https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/new`) will then be a valid reference  to the `Patient` request bundle entry.\n\n## 4.9 Multi-tenancy\nThe FHIR server includes features that allow a single instance of the server to simultaneously support multiple tenants. A tenant is defined as a group of one or more FHIR REST API consumers that share a FHIR server configuration along with one or more data stores associated with that configuration. A tenant could be a single application using the FHIR REST API, or it could be a group of applications belonging to a single customer. The main idea behind multi-tenancy is that each tenant can experience its own customized FHIR server runtime behavior and its data can be physically isolated from other tenants' data for increased security and privacy.\n\n### 4.9.1 Specifying the tenant id\nTo support multi-tenancy, the FHIR server must know which tenant an incoming REST API request is intended for. To provide the tenant id to the FHIR server, a REST API consumer must set a request header in each REST API request. The name of this request header is itself configurable by setting the `fhirServer/core/tenantIdHeaderName` configuration property in the FHIR server's global configuration file (located at `$⁠{server.config.dir}/config/default/fhir-server-config.json`). The following example shows the default setting for this configuration parameter:\n```\n\n{\n  \"fhirServer\":{\n      \"core\":{\n            \"tenantIdHeaderName\":\"X-FHIR-TENANT-ID\"\n      },\n      …\n   }\n}\n```\n\nWith this configuration in place, each REST API consumer would need to set the `X-FHIR-TENANT-ID` request header to the appropriate tenant id. Each tenant's tenant id value is assigned by the deployer. It is simply a short name associated with the tenant and must be unique among all tenants supported by a single FHIR server instance. For example, let's suppose Acme Healthcare, Inc. is using the FHIR server and their tenant id has been assigned by the deployer as “acme”. In this case, Acme-related applications would set the following request header in each REST API request: `X-FHIR-TENANT-ID: acme`\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the name of the request header is configurable in the FHIR server's global configuration file. For example, the FHIR server deployer could configure the request header name to be `X-WHCLSF-tenant-id` by setting `tenantIdHeaderName` as shown in the following example:\n```\n{\n   \"fhirServer\":{\n      \"core\":{\n            \"tenantIdHeaderName\":\"X-WHCLSF-tenant-id\"\n      },\n      …\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThis would be useful in an environment where the applications might already be using a similar type of request header. With this configuration in place, the “Acme Healthcare, Inc.” tenant would set the following request header in each REST API request:\n    `X-WHCLSF-tenant-id: acme`\n\n\n### 4.9.2 Configuration properties\nThe FHIR server allows a deployer to configure a subset of the supported configuration properties on a tenant-specific basis.\nFor a complete list of configuration properties supported on a per-tenant basis, see [Section 5.1.3 Property attributes](#513-property-attributes).\n\nWhen the FHIR server needs to retrieve any of the tenant-specific configuration properties, it does so dynamically each time the property value is needed. This means that a deployer can change the value of a tenant-specific property within a tenant's configuration file on disk, and the FHIR server will immediately “see” the new value the next time it tries to retrieve it. For example, suppose the deployer initially defines the `acme` tenant's `fhir-server-config.json` file such that the `fhirServer/core/defaultPrettyPrint` property is set to true.\n\nRequests from the `acme` tenant would result in pretty-printed responses (with newlines and indentation), making it easier for humans to read.\nNow suppose the deployer changes the value of that property to true within the `acme` tenant's `fhir-server-config.json` file.\nA subsequent REST API request would then see the output condensed into a single line with minimal whitespace.\n\n#### 4.9.2.1 Examples\nThis section contains examples of both a global (default) configuration and a tenant-specific configuration.\n\n##### Global configuration (default)\nThe global configuration contains non-tenant specific configuration parameters (configuration parameters that are not resolved or used on a tenant-specific basis), as well as default values for tenant-specific configuration parameters.\n\n`${server.config.dir}/config/default/fhir-server-config.json`\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"__comment\":\"FHIR server global (default) configuration\",\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        \"core\":{\n            \"defaultPrettyPrint\":false,\n            \"tenantIdHeaderName\":\"X-FHIR-TENANT-ID\"\n        },\n        \"notifications\":{\n            \"common\":{\n                \"includeResourceTypes\":[\n                    \"QuestionnaireResponse\",\n                    \"CarePlan\",\n                    \"MedicationAdministration\",\n                    \"Device\",\n                    \"DeviceComponent\",\n                    \"DeviceMetric\",\n                    \"MedicationOrder\",\n                    \"Observation\"\n                ]\n            },\n            \"websocket\":{\n                \"enabled\":false\n            },\n            \"kafka\":{\n                \"enabled\":false,\n                \"topicName\":\"fhirNotifications\",\n                \"connectionProperties\":{\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        \"audit\": {\n            \"serviceClassName\" : \"com.ibm.fhir.audit.impl.NopService\",\n            \"serviceProperties\" : {\n            }\n        },\n        \"persistence\":{\n            \"factoryClassname\":\"com.ibm.fhir.persistence.jdbc.FHIRPersistenceJDBCFactory\",\n            \"common\":{\n                \"__comment\":\"Configuration properties common to all persistence layer implementations\",\n                \"updateCreateEnabled\":true\n            },\n            \"jdbc\":{\n                \"__comment\":\"Configuration properties for the JDBC persistence implementation\",\n            },\n        …\n        }\n    …\n    }\n```\n\n##### Acme Healthcare, Inc. (acme)\nThe Acme Healthcare, Inc tenant configuration overrides the `fhirServer/core/defaultPrettyPrint` property so that the development\nteam can more easilly read the messages.\n\n`${server.config.dir}/config/acme/fhir-server-config.json`\n\n```\n{\n    \"__comment\":\"FHIR server configuration for tenant: Acme Healthcare, Inc.\",\n    \"fhirServer\":{\n        \"core\":{\n            \"defaultPrettyPrint\":true\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt is also possible to configure the persistence properties for a specific tenant, for example to set an alternate\ndatabase hostname or database schema name.\n\n## 4.10 Bulk data operations\nThe IBM FHIR Server implements bulk data export according to the [HL7 FHIR BulkDataAccess IG: STU1](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1/export/index.html), and bulk data import is implemented according to the [Proposal for $import Operation](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/bulk-import/blob/main/import.md).\n\nThere are 2 modules involved:\n\n- fhir-operation-bulkdata\n- fhir-bulkdata-webapp   \n\nThe *fhir-operation-bulkdata* module implements the REST APIs for bulk data export, import and status as FHIR Operations.  There are five operations:\n\n| Operation | Path |\n|-----|-----|\n| ExportOperation| system `$export` |\n| PatientExportOperation| Patient `Patient/$export` |\n| GroupExportOperation| Group `Group/[id]/$export` |\n| ImportOperation | import resources using the system endpoint, `$import` |\n| StatusOperation | polling status for import and export `$bulkdata-status` |\n\nEach operation queues a job with the Open Liberty JavaBatch framework. Each job instance unit-of-work is executed as a job with the *fhir-bulkdata-webapp* module. There are 5 JavaBatch jobs defined in the *fhir-bulkdata-webapp* module for the above 3 export operations and 1 import operation:\n\n| Java Batch Job | Operation |\n|-----|-----|\n| FhirBulkExportChunkJob| `$export` |\n| FhirBulkExportFastJob| `$export` |\n| FhirBulkExportPatientChunkJob| `Patient/$export` |\n| FhirBulkExportGroupChunkJob| `Group/[id]/$export` |\n| FhirBulkImportChunkJob | `$import` |\n\nThe *fhir-bulkdata-webapp* module is a wrapper for the whole BulkData web application, which is the build artifact - fhir-bulkdata-webapp.war. This web archive is copied to the `apps/` directory of the liberty server. The feature is configured using the `configDropins/default/bulkdata.xml`, such as:\n\n```xml\n<webApplication id=\"fhir-bulkdata-webapp\" location=\"fhir-bulkdata-webapp.war\" name=\"fhir-bulkdata-webapp\">\n    <classloader privateLibraryRef=\"configResources,fhirUserLib\"/>\n    <application-bnd>\n        <security-role id=\"users\" name=\"FHIRUsers\">\n            <group id=\"bulkUsersGroup\" name=\"FHIRUsers\"/>\n        </security-role>\n    </application-bnd>\n</webApplication>\n```\n\nThe Bulk Data web application writes the exported FHIR resources to an IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS), any Amazon S3-Compatible bucket (e.g, Amazon S3, minIO etc), or directory as configured in the per-tenant server configuration under `fhirServer/bulkdata`. The following is an example configuration for bulkdata; please refer to section 5 for the detailed description of these properties:\n\n``` json\n\"bulkdata\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"core\": {\n        \"api\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://localhost:9443/ibm/api/batch\",\n            \"user\": \"fhiradmin\",\n            \"password\": \"change-password\",\n            \"truststore\": \"resources/security/fhirTrustStore.p12\",\n            \"truststorePassword\": \"change-password\"\n        },\n        \"cos\" : {\n            \"useServerTruststore\": true\n        },\n        \"pageSize\": 100,\n        \"batchIdEncryptionKey\": \"example-password\",\n        \"maxPartitions\": 3,\n        \"maxInputs\": 5\n    },\n    \"storageProviders\": {\n        \"default\" : {\n            \"type\": \"file\",\n            \"fileBase\": \"/output/bulkdata\",\n            \"disableOperationOutcomes\": true,\n            \"duplicationCheck\": false,\n            \"validateResources\": false\n        },\n        \"minio\" : {\n            \"type\": \"aws-s3\",\n            \"bucketName\": \"fhirbulkdata\",\n            \"location\": \"us\",\n            \"endpointInternal\": \"https://minio:9000\",\n            \"endpointExternal\": \"https://localhost:9000\",\n            \"auth\" : {\n                \"type\": \"hmac\",\n                \"accessKeyId\": \"example\",\n                \"secretAccessKey\": \"example-password\"\n            },\n            \"disableBaseUrlValidation\": true,\n            \"disableOperationOutcomes\": true,\n            \"duplicationCheck\": false,\n            \"validateResources\": false,\n            \"create\": false,\n            \"presigned\": true\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEach tenant's configuration may define multiple storageProviders. The default is assumed, unless specified with the `X-FHIR-BULKDATA-PROVIDER` and `X-FHIR-BULKDATA-PROVIDER-OUTCOME`. Each tenant's configuration may mix the different providers, however each provider is only of a single type. For instance, `minio` is `aws-s3` and `default` is `file`. Note, type `http` is only applicable to `$import` operations. Export is only supported with s3 and file.\n\nTo use Amazon S3 bucket for exporting, please set `accessKeyId` to S3 access key, and set `secretAccessKey` to the S3 secret key, and the auth type to `hmac`.\n\nBasic system exports to S3 without typeFilters use a streamlined implementation which bypasses the IBM FHIR Server Search API for direct access to the data enabling better throughput. The `fhirServer/bulkdata/core/systemExportImpl` property can be used to disable the streamlined system export implementation. To use the legacy implementation based on IBM FHIR Server search, set the value to \"legacy\". The new system export implementation is used by default for any export not using typeFilters. Exports using typeFilters use FHIR Search, and cannot use the streamlined export.\n\nTo import using the `$import` operation with `https`, one must additionally configure the `fhirServer/bulkdata/storageProviders/(source)/validBaseUrls`. For example, if one stores bulk data at `https://test-url1.cos.ibm.com/bucket1/test.ndjson` and `https://test-url2.cos.ibm.com/bucket2/test2.ndjson` you must specify both baseUrls in the configuration:\n\n```json\n    \"validBaseUrls\": [\n        \"https://test-url1.cos.ibm.com/bucket1\",\n        \"https://test-url2.cos.ibm.com/bucket2\"\n    ]\n```\n\nThese base urls are not checked when using cloud object store and bulk-import. If you need to disable the validBaseUrls feature you may add `fhirServer/bulkdata/storageProviders/(source)/disableBaseUrlValidation` as `true`.\n\nFor Bulk Data import, the `fhirServer/bulkdata/core/maxInputs` is used to configure a maximum number of inputs supported by the instance. The default number is 5. There is a hard character limit on the total input type and url must be under 4096 characters, as such the configuration may be tuned for each url scheme.\n\nNote: When `$import` is executed, if a resource to import includes a `Resource.id` then this id is honored (via create-on-update). If `Resource.id` is not valued, the server will perform a create and assign a new `Resource.id` for this resource.\n\nFollowing is the beautified response of sample polling location request after the export is finished:\n\n```json\n{\n\"transactionTime\": \"2020/01/20 16:53:41.160 -0500\",\n\"request\": \"https://myserver/fhir-server/api/v4/$export?_type=Patient\",\n\"requiresAccessToken\": false,\n\"output\" : [\n  { \"type\" : \"AllergyIntolerance\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/fhir-bulkimexport-connectathon/6SfXzbGvYl1nTjGbf5qeqJDFNjyljiGdKxXEJb4yJn8=/AllergyIntolerance_1.ndjson\",\n    \"count\": 20},\n  { \"type\" : \"AllergyIntolerance\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/fhir-bulkimexport-connectathon/6SfXzbGvYl1nTjGbf5qeqJDFNjyljiGdKxXEJb4yJn8=/AllergyIntolerance_2.ndjson\",\n    \"count\": 8},\n  { \"type\" : \"Observation\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/fhir-bulkimexport-connectathon/6SfXzbGvYl1nTjGbf5qeqJDFNjyljiGdKxXEJb4yJn8=/Observation_1.ndjson\",\n    \"count\": 234},\n  { \"type\" : \"Observation\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/fhir-bulkimexport-connectathon/6SfXzbGvYl1nTjGbf5qeqJDFNjyljiGdKxXEJb4yJn8=/Observation_2.ndjson\",\n    \"count\": 81}]\n}\n```\n\nFor the Import Operation, the polled status includes an indication of `$import` and the location of the OperationOutcome NDJSON files and the corresponding failure and success counts.\n\nFor S3 exports, the bulk data feature may use presigned urls.  To enable presigned urls, the authentication type must be `hmac` and `fhirServer/bulkdata/storageProviders/(source)/presigned` must be `true`.  The urls become:\n\n```\nhttps://s3.appdomain.cloud/fhir-example/Patient_1.ndjson?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=fcEXbf9cc1ac49e99eEX77%2F20210228%2Fus%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210EXT160538Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5ecfc207546b9737fd38d4f0EXEX1c58f4f82976338a44c\n```\n\nThe presigned URL is valid for 86400 seconds (1 day).\n\nTo cancel a running job (or delete a completed job), issue an HTTP DELETE request to the polling URL.\n* Invoking DELETE on a running job will return HTTP 202 (Accepted) and stop the job\n* Invoking DELETE on a completed job will return HTTP 204 (Deleted) and delete the job\n* Invoking DELETE on a deleted job will return a 404 (Not Found)\n\nPrior to version 4.8.1, the exported `ndjson` file is configured with public access automatically and with 2 hours expiration time using `fhirServer/bulkdata/storageProviders/(source)/exportPublic`. The exported content is best made available with  presigned urls with the `hmac` authentication type.\n\nIn 4.8.1, the randomly generated path is used to uniquely identify the exported files in a single folder.\n\nJavaBatch feature must be enabled in `server.xml` as following on the Liberty server:\n\n```xml\n<featureManager>\n    ...\n    <feature>batchManagement-1.0</feature>\n    ...\n</featureManager>\n```\n\nThe JavaBatch user is configured in `bulkdata.xml` and the `fhir-server-config.json`:\n\n```xml\n<authorization-roles id=\"com.ibm.ws.batch\">\n\t<security-role name=\"batchAdmin\">\n\t\t<user name=\"fhiradmin\"/>\n\t</security-role>\n\t<security-role name=\"batchSubmitter\">\n\t\t<user name=\"fhiruser\"/>\n\t</security-role>\n\t<security-role name=\"batchMonitor\">\n\t\t<user name=\"fhiradmin\"/>\n\t\t<user name=\"fhiruser\"/>\n\t</security-role>\n</authorization-roles>\n```\n\nNote: The batch-user referenced in the `fhir-server-config.json` must have a role of at least batchSubmitter.\n\nBy default, in-memory Derby database is used for persistence of the JavaBatch Jobs as configured in `fhir-server/configDropins/defaults/bulkdata.xml`. This database is destroyed on the restart of the IBM FHIR Server, and does not support load balancing.\n\nTo support IBM Db2 on IBM Cloud, copy `fhir-server/configDropins/disabled/db2-cloud/bulkdata.xml` to `fhir-server/configDropins/defaults/bulkdata.xml` replacing the existing bulkdata.xml. One can configure the Datasource by setting the following environment variables:\n\n| Variable          | Default     | Description                                                    |\n|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| BATCH_DB_HOSTNAME | `blank`     | The hostname of the db2 instance                               |\n| BATCH_DB_NAME     | BLUDB       | The database name                                              |\n| BATCH_DB_SCHEMA   | FHIR_JBATCH | The Schema Name configured to support the Java Batch framework |\n| BATCH_DB_PORT     | 50001       | The port configured to support the database                    |\n| BATCH_DB_APIKEY   | `blank`     | The API Key for the Db2 Cloud database                         |\n\nInstruction is also provided in 'Configuring a Liberty Datasource with API Key' section of the DB2OnCloudSetup guide to configure DB2 service in IBM Clouds as JavaBatch persistence store. The JavaBatch schema is created using the `fhir-persistence-schema` command line interface jar.\n\nTo support IBM Db2 with a user-name and password , copy `fhir-server/configDropins/disabled/db2/bulkdata.xml` to `fhir-server/configDropins/defaults/bulkdata.xml` replacing the existing bulkdata.xml. One can configure the Datasource by setting the following environment variables:\n\n| Variable          | Default         | Description                                                    |\n|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| BATCH_DB_HOSTNAME | `blank`         | The hostname of the db2 instance                               |\n| BATCH_DB_NAME     | FHIRDB          | The database name                                              |\n| BATCH_DB_SCHEMA   | FHIR_JBATCH     | The Schema Name configured to support the Java Batch framework |\n| BATCH_DB_PORT     | 50000           | The port configured to support the database                    |\n| BATCH_DB_USER     | db2inst1        | The user for the Db2 database                                  |\n| BATCH_DB_PASSWORD | `blank`         | The password for the Db2 database                              |\n| BATCH_DB_SSL      | true            | The ssl connection is either true or false                     |\n\nIf one wants to support Postgres with a user-name and password , one should copy `fhir-server/configDropins/disabled/postgres/bulkdata.xml` to `fhir-server/configDropins/defaults/bulkdata.xml` replacing the existing bulkdata.xml. One can configure the Datasource by setting the following environment variables:\n\n| Variable               | Default         | Description                                                    |\n|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| BATCH_DB_HOSTNAME      | `blank`         | The hostname of the postgres instance                          |\n| BATCH_DB_NAME          | FHIRDB          | The database name                                              |\n| BATCH_DB_SCHEMA        | FHIR_JBATCH     | The Schema Name configured to support the Java Batch framework |\n| BATCH_DB_PORT          | 5432            | The port configured to support the database                    |\n| BATCH_DB_USER          | fhirserver      | The user for the postgres database                             |\n| BATCH_DB_PASSWORD      | `blank`         | The password for the postgres database                         |\n| BATCH_DB_SSL           | true            | The ssl connection is either true or false                     |\n| BATCH_DB_SSL_CERT_PATH | false           | The ssl connection is either true or false                     |\n\nNote: If you use PostgreSQL database as IBM FHIR Server data store or the JavaBatch job repository, please enable `max_prepared_transactions` in postgresql.conf, otherwise the import/export JavaBatch jobs fail.\n\nFor more information about Liberty JavaBatch configuration, please refer to [IBM WebSphere Liberty Java Batch White paper](https://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/webindex/wp102544).\n\nIf you are running in a Kubernetes deployment, be sure to set the environment variable MY_POD_NAME to `metadata.name` as shown in [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/Alvearie/alvearie-helm/blob/main/charts/ibm-fhir-server/templates/deployment.yaml#:~:text=MY_POD_NAME). This setting allows the stopping and deleting of jobs on all the hosts in the deployment.\n\n### 4.10.1 *Path* and *Virtual Host* Bucket Access\n\nFor BulkData storage types of `ibm-cos` and `aws-s3`, the IBM FHIR Server supports two styles of accessing the `s3` bucket - virtual host and path.  In the IBM FHIR Server, `path` is the default access. [Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html)\n\nWith path style access, the objects in a bucket are accessed using the pattern - `https://s3.region.host-name.com/bucket-name/object-key`. To configure path style access, one needs to configure the fhir-server-config.json.\n\nThere are three critical elements in the configuration to configure path style:\n\n|Configuration|Details|\n|-------------|-------|\n|`endpointInternal`|the direct S3 API provider for the S3 API|\n|`endpointExternal`|the endpoint url used to generate the downloadUrl used in S3 Export|\n|`accessType`|\"path\", the default access type|\n\nExample of `path` based access:\n\n``` json\n\"bulkdata\": {\n    ...\n    \"storageProviders\": {\n        \"default\" : {\n            \"type\": \"aws-s3\",\n            \"bucketName\": \"bucket-name\",\n            \"location\": \"us\",\n            \"endpointInternal\": \"https://s3.region.host-name.com\",\n            \"endpointExternal\": \"https://s3.region.host-name.com\",\n            \"auth\" : {\n                \"type\": \"hmac\",\n                \"accessKeyId\": \"example\",\n                \"secretAccessKey\": \"example-password\"\n            },\n            \"disableBaseUrlValidation\": true,\n            \"disableOperationOutcomes\": true,\n            \"duplicationCheck\": false,\n            \"validateResources\": false,\n            \"create\": false,\n            \"presigned\": true,\n            \"accessType\": \"path\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith virtual host style access, the objects in a bucket are accessed using the pattern - `https://bucket-name.s3.region.host-name.com/object-key`. To configure virtual host style access, one needs to configure the API.\n\nThere are three critical elements in the configuration to configure virtual host style:\n\n|Configuration|Details|\n|-------------|-------|\n|`endpointInternal`|the direct API provider for the S3 API, and not the virtual host, the underlying S3 libraries generate the virtual host url|\n|`endpointExternal`|the Virtual Host endpoint url used to generate the downloadUrl generated after an Export|\n|`accessType`|\"host\"|\n\nNote, while the endpointInternal is specified with the S3 region endpoint, the calls to the API will use the virtual host directly.\n\nExample of `host` based access:\n\n``` json\n\"bulkdata\": {\n    ...\n    \"storageProviders\": {\n        \"default\" : {\n            \"type\": \"aws-s3\",\n            \"bucketName\": \"bucket-name\",\n            \"location\": \"us\",\n            \"endpointInternal\": \"https://s3.region.host-name.com\",\n            \"endpointExternal\": \"https://bucket-name.s3.region.host-name.com\",\n            \"auth\" : {\n                \"type\": \"hmac\",\n                \"accessKeyId\": \"example\",\n                \"secretAccessKey\": \"example-password\"\n            },\n            \"disableBaseUrlValidation\": true,\n            \"disableOperationOutcomes\": true,\n            \"duplicationCheck\": false,\n            \"validateResources\": false,\n            \"create\": false,\n            \"presigned\": true,\n            \"accessType\": \"host\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.10.2 S3 Import File with matching segments\n\nWhen Importing from an S3 Bucket, the IBM FHIR Server identifies the matching file segments. The `parameter.input.url` is used to query the S3 API to find the matching files.  For instance, the following import of `Patient.ndjson` matches `Patient.ndjson_seg0` and `Patient.ndjson_seg1` which are imported to the IBM FHIR Server.\n\nThis feature is useful for imports which follow a prefix pattern:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"resourceType\": \"Parameters\",\n    \"id\": \"30321130-5032-49fb-be54-9b8b82b2445a\",\n    \"parameter\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"inputFormat\",\n            \"valueString\": \"application/fhir+ndjson\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"inputSource\",\n            \"valueUri\": \"https://localhost:9443/source-fhir-server\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"input\",\n            \"part\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"type\",\n                    \"valueString\": \"Patient\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"url\",\n                    \"valueUrl\": \"test-import.ndjson\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"storageDetail\",\n            \"valueString\": \"ibm-cos\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### 4.10.3 Integration Testing\nTo integration test, there are tests in `ExportOperationTest.java` in `fhir-server-test` module with server integration test cases for system, patient and group export. Further, there are tests in `ImportOperationTest.java` in `fhir-server-test` module. These tests rely on the `fhir-server-config-db2.json` which specifies two storageProviders.\n\n### 4.10.5 Job Logs\nBecause the bulk import and export operations are built on Liberty's java batch implementation, users may need to check the [Liberty batch job logs](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_batch_view_joblog.html) for detailed step information / troubleshooting.\n\nIn a standard installation, these logs will be at `wlp/usr/servers/fhir-server/logs/joblogs`.\nIn the `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server` docker image, these logs will be at `/logs/joblogs`.\n\nNote, if you are using the default derby, the logs are overwritten upon restart of the server. You should use Db2 or Postgres for production purposes.\n\n### 4.10.6 Known Limitations\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server's fhir-bulkdata-webapp does not support [persistence interceptors](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/blob/main/docs/src/pages/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide.md#43-persistence-interceptors). Therefor, $import requests will not lead to `beforeCreate`/`beforeUpdate` or `afterCreate`/`afterUpdate` method calls and $export requests will not lead to `beforeRead`/`beforeSearch` or `afterRead`/`afterSearch` method calls.\nBecause the IBM FHIR Server's notifications feature is implemented as a persistence interceptor, bulk operations will not result in any notification events.\n\n## 4.11 Audit logging service\nThe Audit logging service pushes FHIR server audit events for FHIR operations in [Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF)](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf) standard format to a Kafka backend, such as *IBM Cloud Event Streams service*.\n\nThere is early support for the [FHIR Standard: AuditEvent format](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/auditevent.html).\n\n### 4.11.1 CADF audit log entry\n\nEach FHIR interaction triggers a CADF audit log entry to be logged. The mapping of FHIR interaction to CADF action is as follows:\n\n| FHIR Interaction                                    | CADF Action |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n|`history,metadata,read,search,validate,version read` |   read      |\n|`create`                                             |   create    |\n|`update`                                             |   update    |\n|`delete`                                             |   delete    |\n|`bundle,custom operation,patch`                      |   unknown   |\n\nThe following table describes the JSON fields of the CADF audit log entries logged by the FHIR server:\n\n| CADF Audit Log Entry Field                           | Description |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n|`action`                                              |Action that created the audit event.

Possible values are \"success\", \"failure\", \"unknown\", and \"pending\".|\n|`typeURI`                                             |TypeURI property of the CADF event entity. Value is always \"http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event\".|\n|`attachments`                                         |Note: Contains FHIR server-specific audit event data.|\n|`attachments/contentType`                             |FHIR server-specific audit event data content type. Value is always \"application/json\".|\n|`attachments/content`                                 |Note: Contents of this field (with its subfields) is encoded as Base64.\n|`attachments/content/request_unique_id`               |Globally unique identifier for the FHIR server request.|\n|`attachments/content/action`                          |FHIR action type.

The first type is using the environment variable, and the second is the configuration driven from the fhir-server-config.json.\n\nFor example, the following uses the 'config' in order to config the Kafka publisher as part of the audit logging service.\n\n```\n\"audit\": {\n    \"serviceClassName\" : \"com.ibm.fhir.audit.impl.KafkaService\",\n    \"serviceProperties\" : {\n        \"load\": \"config\",\n    }\n```\n\nOr, you could load from an environment, note, this is the default behavior.\n\n```\n\"audit\": {\n    \"serviceClassName\" : \"com.ibm.fhir.audit.impl.KafkaService\",\n    \"serviceProperties\" : {\n        \"load\": \"environment\",\n    }\n```\n\n#### 4.11.3.1 Environment Variable Configuration of audit logging service\n\nThe audit logging service gets the event streams service credential from environment variable EVENT_STREAMS_AUDIT_BINDING with values like this:\n\n```\n    {\n  \"api_key\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n  \"apikey\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n   …\n  \"kafka_brokers_sasl\": [\n    \"broker-1-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-2-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-5-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-4-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-3-0server:9093\",\n    \"broker-0-0server:9093\"\n  ],\n   …\n}\n```\n\nIf you are using the IBM EventStreams on IBM Cloud, the service credential can be generated automatically when you run:\n\n```\n    ibmcloud ks cluster-service-bind --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --namespace <namespace> --service <event_streams_service_instance_name> …\n```\n\nto bind your event streams service instance to your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nAnd then in the YAML file for your Kubernetes deployment, specify the environment variable EVENT_STREAMS_AUDIT_BINDING that references the binding key of the generated secret(binding-<event_streams_service_instance_name>) as following:\n\n```\n            - name: EVENT_STREAMS_AUDIT_BINDING\n                valueFrom:\n                  secretKeyRef:\n                    key: binding\n                    name: binding-<event_streams_service_instance_name>\n```\n\nPlease refer to https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-binding for detailed instructions if needed.\n\n#### 4.11.3.2 fhir-server-config.json Configuration of audit logging service\n\n```\n\"audit\": {\n    \"serviceClassName\" : \"com.ibm.fhir.audit.impl.KafkaService\",\n    \"serviceProperties\" : {\n        \"load\": \"config\",\n        \"mapper\": \"cadf\",\n        \"auditTopic\": \"FHIR_AUDIT\",\n        \"geoCity\": \"Dallas\",\n        \"geoState\": \"TX\",\n        \"geoCounty\": \"US\",\n        \"kafka\" : {\n            \"sasl.jaas.config\": \"********\",\n            \"bootstrap.servers\": \"********\",\n            \"sasl.mechanism\": \"PLAIN\",\n            \"security.protocol\": \"SASL_SSL\",\n            \"ssl.protocol\": \"TLSv1.2\",\n            \"ssl.enabled.protocols\": \"TLSv1.2\",\n            \"ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm\": \"HTTPS\"\n        },\n        \"kafkaServers\": \"********\",\n        \"kafkaApiKey\": \"********\"\n    }\n```\n\nThe service can map to the CADF format or the FHIR AuditEvent resource format by declaring a mapper type - 'cadf' or 'auditevent'.\n\n- *CADF* Example\n```\n{\n    \"action\": \"create\",\n    \"eventTime\": \"2020-12-10 16:49:22.307\",\n    \"eventType\": \"activity\",\n    \"id\": \"c62ee8f8-be77-49d0-aad0-c0bf52a05fdf\",\n    \"outcome\": \"success\",\n    \"typeURI\": \"http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event\",\n    \"tags\": [\n    ],\n    \"target\": {\n        \"id\": \"176629076d7-ef3e8608-cd07-4c20-8823-ddfe46237052\",\n        \"typeURI\": \"data/database\",\n        \"addresses\": [\n            {\n                \"url\": \"https://test.io:443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient\",\n                \"name\": \"\",\n                \"port\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"geolocation\": {\n            \"city\": \"Hamil\",\n            \"state\": \"TEXAS\",\n            \"region\": \"USA\",\n            \"annotations\": [\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"attachments\": [\n        {\n            \"contentType\": \"application/json\",\n            \"content\": \"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\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"initiator\": {\n        \"id\": \"default@fhir-server\",\n        \"typeURI\": \"compute/machine\",\n        \"host\": \"192.168.86.20\",\n        \"credential\": {\n            \"token\": \"user-fhiruser\"\n        },\n        \"geolocation\": {\n            \"city\": \"Dallas\",\n            \"state\": \"TX\",\n            \"region\": \"US\",\n            \"annotations\": [\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"observer\": {\n        \"id\": \"fhir-server\",\n        \"typeURI\": \"compute/node\",\n        \"name\": \"IBM FHIR Server -

Another option is to configure Event Streams (Kafka) S3 connect to push those CADF events to a COS bucket (e.g. fhir-audit-dev) but in raw CADF json format.\n\nA service instance of the [IBM Cloud SQL Query](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/analyzing-data-with-ibm-cloud-sql-query) service can be created to allow you to query those CADF audit events in COS with SQL queries. Before running an SQL query, it's recommended to first create a COS bucket to store your query results, otherwise the query results will be stored in a bucket which is automatically created by the SQL query service.\n\nSample queries for CSV records expanded from the JSON CADF events:\n\n```\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-07\" and \"2019-06-08\" and action=\"unknown\" into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as csv\n\nselect action, count(*) from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-05\" and \"2019-06-06\" group by action into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as csv\n\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-05\" and \"2019-06-06\" and action=\"create\" and initiator_id=\"default@fhir-server\" into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as csv\n\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-05\" and \"2019-06-06\" and ATTACHMENTS_CONTENT LIKE '%fhir-read%' into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as csv\n```\n\nSample queries for the raw JSON CADF events:\n\n```\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0 stored as json where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-01\" and \"2019-06-08\" and action=\"unknown\" into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0-res stored as json\n\nselect action, count(*) from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0 stored as json where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-01\" and \"2019-06-06\" group by action into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0-res stored as csv\n\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0 stored as json where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-01\" and \"2019-06-06\" and action=\"create\" and initiator.id=\"default@fhir-server\" into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as json\n\nselect * from cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev0 stored as json where EVENTTIME BETWEEN \"2019-06-01\" and \"2019-06-06\" and ATTACHMENTS[0].CONTENT LIKE '%fhir-read%' into cos://us-south/fhir-audit-dev-res stored as json\n\n```\n\n## 4.12 FHIR REST API\nBy default, the IBM FHIR Server allows the following RESTful interactions associated with the FHIR REST API: `create`, `read`, `vread`, `history`, `search`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`. However, it is possible to configure which of these interactions are allowed on a per resource basis through a set of interaction rules specified via the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property in `fhir-server-config.json`. The following snippet shows the general form for specifying interaction rules:\n\n```\n\"resources\": {\n    \"open\": true,\n    \"Condition\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Observation\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Patient\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\"]\n    },\n    \"Procedure\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"delete\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property is a JSON array of strings that represent the RESTful interactions allowed for the given resource type. If an interaction is not in the list of strings specified for a resource type, that interaction will not be allowed for that resource type. In the example above, the following interactions are allowed for the `Observation` resource type: [`create`, `read`, `vread`, `history`, `delete`]. This means a user will not be able to search for `Observation` resources because the `search` interaction is not specified in the list of allowed interactions.\n\nOmitting the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property is equivalent to allowing all interactions for a given resource type. An empty array, `[]`, can be used to indicate that no interactions are allowed. Additionally, to define the set of interactions allowed for resource types which are not specifically configured in the `fhirServer/resources` property group, or for resource types which are configured, but which do not specify the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property, the base type of `Resource` may be specified:\n\n```\n\"resources\": {\n    \"open\": true,\n    \"Condition\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\", \"update\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Observation\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Patient\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\"]\n    },\n    \"Procedure\": {\n    },\n    \"Resource\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, for any resource type which is not specifically configured, such as `Encounter`, or for any resource type which is configured but does not specify the `fhirServer/resources/<resourceType>/interactions` property, such as `Procedure`, all of the interactions listed for the `Resource` resource type will be allowed.\n\nOne final consideration when configuring interactions is the `fhirServer/resources/open` property. If this property is specified and its value is set to `false`, then no interactions will be allowed for resource types which are not specifically listed in the `fhirServer/resources` property group. Assume the following configuration:\n\n```\n\"resources\": {\n    \"open\": false,\n    \"Condition\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\", \"update\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Observation\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"create\", \"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"delete\"]\n    },\n    \"Patient\": {\n        \"interactions\": [\"read\", \"vread\", \"history\", \"search\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, since the `fhirServer/resources/open` property is set to `false`, only the resource types listed (`Condition`, `Observation`, `Patient`) are allowed to be interacted with via the FHIR REST API. For example, a `create` request of a `Procedure` resource will fail since that resource type is not specified.\n\nWhole-system search and whole-system history are special cases. Since no resource type is specified on a whole-system request, validation will be done against the `Resource` resource type. In the above configuration example, a whole-system search request such as `GET [base]?_lastUpdated=gt2020-01-01` will fail because the `Resource` resource type is not specified. If the configuration were to have the `fhirServer/resources/open` property set to `true`, or if the `Resource` resource type were specified in the `fhirServer/resources` property group, then the whole-system search request would be allowed, assuming the `search` interaction was valid for the `Resource` resource type.\n\nIn addition to interaction configuration, the `fhirServer/resources` property group also provides the ability to configure search parameter filtering and profile validation. See [Search configuration](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRSearchConfiguration#13-filtering) and [Resource validation](#44-resource-validation) respectively for details.\n\nUnlike most other tenant-specific properties, the `fhirServer/resources` property group is processed as a single unit. In the event that `fhirServer/resources` exists in a tenant-specific config, but a particular sub-property is missing (e.g. `fhirServer/resources/open`), that sub-property will *not* inheret from the \"default\" tenant.\n\n## 4.12.1 Using the IBM FHIR Server behind a proxy\nIt is possible to run the IBM FHIR Server behind a reverse proxy such as Kubernetes Ingress or an API Gateway.\n\nBecause the FHIR API relies on links and references between resources (both absolute and relative), operators must ensure that the IBM FHIR Server is configured appropriately for the front-end URL being used by the FHIR clients.\n\nThis can be accomplished by configuring the `fhirServer/core/originalRequestUriHeaderName` property in the default fhir-server-config.json. When this parameter is configured, the IBM FHIR Server will use the value of the corresponding header to set the \"originalRequestUri\" for the scope of the request.\n\nFor example, consider a FHIR Server that is listening at https://fhir:9443/fhir-server/api/v4 and is configured with an  originalRequestUriHeaderName of `X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL`. If this server is proxied by a server at https://example.com/fhir, then the proxy must set the `X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL` header to the value of the front-end request URL (e.g. https://example.com/fhir/Patient/abc-123). In alternative deployments, the `fhirServer/core/externalBaseUrl` may be used in-lieu of the `X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL`.\n\nThe originalRequestUriHeader is expected to contain the full path of the original request. Values with no scheme (e.g. `https://`) will be handled like relative URLs, but full URL values (including scheme, hostname, optional port, and path) are recommended. Query string values can be included in the header value but will be ignored by the server; the server will use the query string of the actual request to process the request.\n\n### 4.13 Remote Index Service\n\nTo use the experimental remote index service feature, see the instructions documented in the [fhir-remote-index](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/FHIR/tree/main/operation/fhir-remote-index/README.md) project.\n\n# 5 Appendix\n\n## 5.1 Configuration properties reference\nThis section contains reference information about each of the configuration properties supported by the FHIR server.\n\n### 5.1.1 Property descriptions\n| Property Name                 | Type | Description     |\n|-------------------------------|------|-----------------|\n|`fhirServer/core/defaultPrettyPrint`|boolean|A boolean flag which indicates whether \"Pretty Printing\" should be used by default.

5.2 Keystores, truststores, and the IBM FHIR server\n\n### 5.2.1 Background\nAs stated earlier, the FHIR server is installed with a default configuration in `server.xml` which includes the definition of a keystore (`fhirKeyStore.p12`) and a truststore (`fhirTrustStore.p12`)<sup id=\"a7\">[7](#f7)</sup>. These files are provided only as examples and while they may suffice in a test environment, the FHIR server deployer should generate a new keystore and truststore for any installations where security is a concern. Review the information in the following topics to learn how to configure a secure keystore and truststore.\n\nAdditionally, the server has a trustDefault.xml config dropin that references the SEC_TLS_TRUSTDEFAULTCERTS variable (defaultValue = true) to indicate whether or not the JVM truststore should be used in combination with the configured trust store.\n\n### 5.2.2 WebApp security\nBy default, the FHIR server REST API is only available via HTTPS on port 9443 and is protected by HTTP basic authentication.\nAlternatively, the server can use OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 via a Bearer Token as described in [Section 5.3 OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0](#53-openid-connect-and-oauth-20).\nIn addition, the FHIR server web application can be secured via client certificate-based authentication.\n\nHere are some notes related to these authentication schemes:\n*   Basic authentication is a very simple authentication scheme and should only be used over HTTPS because the username and password are essentially transmitted in plain text.\n*   OAuth 2.0 authentication can only be used in conjunction with an HTTPS endpoint because the OAuth authorization steps rely on SSL handshake negotiations.\n*   Client certificate-based authentication can only be used in conjunction with an HTTPS endpoint since it involves SSL handshake negotiations. The main value of client authentication is that the server is able to securely authenticate the client through the use of certificates.\n\n### 5.2.3 Configuring mutual TLS authentication\nTo properly configure the FHIR server's keystore and truststore files, perform the following steps.\n\n### 5.2.3.1 Configure the keyStores\n1.  Create a new self-signed server certificate<sup id=\"a8\">[8](#f8)</sup> and store it in a new keystore file located in the `<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/resources/security` directory.\n\n    In these instructions, we'll call this file `serverKeystore.jks`, although you can name your server keystore file anything you choose. We'll use the `keytool`<sup id=\"a9\">[9](#f9)</sup> command for all keystore- and truststore-related steps, although there are several ways to perform these actions.\n\n    The following command will generate a new self-signed certificate and store it in `serverKeystore.jks`:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore serverKeystore.jks -storepass change-password -genkey\n        -alias default -keyalg RSA -keypass change-password\n    ```\n\n2.  Export the server certificate so that it can be imported into the client's truststore:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore serverKeystore.jks -storepass change-password -export\n        -alias default -file server-public-key.cer\n    ```\n\n3.  Create the client's certificate and store it in `clientKeystore.jks`:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore clientKeystore.jks -storepass change-password -genkey\n        -alias client-auth -keyalg RSA -keypass change-password\n    ```\n\n    Note: `keytool` will prompt you for the various components of the distinguished name (DN) associated with the certificate (similar to Step 1). The value that you specify for the common name (CN) component of the DN must match a username in the basic user registry<sup id=\"a10\">[10](#f10)</sup> configured within the `server.xml` file. This step is crucial for the client certificate-based authentication to work properly. The whole point of this authentication scheme is for the client to transmit its identity to the server via the client certificate, and the client's username must be contained in that certificate (the CN component of the DN) so that the FHIR server can properly authenticate the client.\n\n4.  Export the client's certificate so that it can be imported into the server's truststore:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore clientKeystore.jks -storepass change-password -export -alias client-auth -file client-public-key.cer\n    ```\n\n5.  Import the server's public key certificate into the client's truststore:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore clientTruststore.jks -storepass change-password -import -file server-public-key.cer\n    ```\n\n6.  Import the client's public key certificate into the server's truststore:\n\n    ```\n    keytool -keystore serverTruststore.jks -storepass change-password -import -file client-public-key.cer\n    ```\n\nAt this point, you should have a client keystore that contains a client certificate whose Distinguished Name's Common Name component is set to the username. You should also have a client truststore which contains the server's public key certificate. Essentially, the server and client both have a keystore that contains their own private and public key certificate and they both have a truststore which contains the public key certificate of their counterpart.\n\n### 5.2.3.1 Configure the server\nCopy the server keystore (`serverKeystore.jks`) and truststore (`serverTruststore.jks`) files to the appropriate directory (`<WLP_HOME>/usr/servers/fhir-server/resources/security`). Then configure the `server.xml` file correctly to reference your new keystore and truststore files.\n\n### 5.2.3.2 Configure the client\nThe precise steps required to configure certificate-based authentication for a client application depend on the specific REST API client framework, but these are the general rules:\n\n*   If the client is using the FHIR server's HTTPS endpoint, then the client's truststore should be configured with the certificate of the FHIR server<sup id=\"a11\">[11](#f11)</sup>.\n*   If the client is using basic authentication, then it must send an appropriate Authorization request header containing the username and password information in the HTTP request.\n*   If the client is using client certificate-based Authentication, then the client keystore must be configured with a certificate that is trusted by the FHIR server<sup id=\"a12\">[12](#f12)</sup>.\n*   If the client is using OAuth 2.0 Authentication, then the client keystore must be configured with the REST API client framework. In addition, it must send an appropriate Authorization request header containing the Bearer token in the HTTP request.\n\n## 5.3 OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0\nThe FHIR specification recommends the use of OAuth 2.0.\nThe IBM FHIR Server supports OAuth 2.0 through the use of WebSphere Liberty / OpenLiberty features.\n\nWhile it is possible to configure Liberty as an [OpenID Connect Client](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html), more typically the IBM FHIR Server will be configured as a generic OAuth 2.0 \"Protected Resource Server\" that works with JWT access tokens that have been issued by a trusted Authorization Server like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org).\n\n### 5.3.1 Configure Liberty to be an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Server\nLiberty can be configured to act as an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Server via either the [openidConnectClient feature](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/core?topic=connect-configuring-oauth-20-protected-resources-in-liberty) or the [mpJwt feature](https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-jwt.html).\n\nOne advantage of the mpJwt approach is that users can be mapped into pre-defined JEE security roles.\nTo enable this feature without modifying the default `server.xml`, move the `jwtRS.xml` config snippet from `configDropins/disabled/` to `configDropins/defaults/` and modify as desired.\n\nA copy of this snippet is provided here for illustrative purposes:\n```xml\n<server description=\"fhir-server\">\n    <featureManager>\n        <feature>mpJwt-1.1</feature>\n    </featureManager>\n\n    <!-- Override the application-bnd binding of the main webapp -->\n    <webApplication contextRoot=\"fhir-server/api/v4\" id=\"fhir-server-webapp\" location=\"fhir-server.war\" name=\"fhir-server-webapp\">\n        <application-bnd id=\"bind\">\n            <security-role id=\"users\" name=\"FHIRUsers\">\n                <group id=\"usersGroup\" access-id=\"group:https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test/fhirUser\"/>\n            </security-role>\n        </application-bnd>\n    </webApplication>\n\n    <mpJwt id=\"jwtConsumer\"\n           jwksUri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/certs\"\n           issuer=\"https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test\"\n           audiences=\"http://fhir-server:9080/fhir-server/api/v4\"\n           userNameAttribute=\"sub\"\n           groupNameAttribute=\"group\"\n           authFilterRef=\"filter\"/>\n\n    <authFilter id=\"filter\">\n        <requestUrl urlPattern=\"/fhir-server\" />\n        <requestUrl matchType=\"notContain\" urlPattern=\"/fhir-server/api/v4/metadata\" />\n        <requestUrl matchType=\"notContain\" urlPattern=\"/fhir-server/api/v4/.well-known/smart-configuration\" />\n    </authFilter>\n</server>\n```\n\nIn the snippet above, the `mpJwt` element is configured to obtain JWK information from http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/certs and use this to validate JWT tokens that are passed to the server.\n\nAdditionally, the server will validate the `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audiences) claims of the JWT and use the `sub` claim as the user principal (for audit logging).\n\nFinally, the value(s) of the `group` claim are used to map this user into a corresponding JEE security-role as defined in the `application-bnd` section of the `webApplication` element.\n\n### 5.3.2 Advertise the OAuth endpoints via fhir-server-config\nTo make the FHIR Server advertise the OAuth endpoints of the configured provider, supply values for at least the following properties in the default fhir-server-config.json file:\n* `fhirServer/security/oauth/authUrl`\n* `fhirServer/security/oauth/tokenUrl`\n\nThese values will be used to populate the corresponding entries in both the server capability statement (`GET [base]/metadata`) and the smart-configuration (`GET [base]/.well-known/smart-configuration`).\n\nFor example, the following excerpt from a CapabilityStatement shows sample OAuth-related URLs (register, authorize, and token) values in the `valueUri` elements.\n```\n…\n\"rest\": [\n    {\n        \"mode\": \"server\",\n        \"security\": {\n        \"extension\": [\n            {\n                \"url\": \"http://fhir-registry.smarthealthit.org/StructureDefinition/oauth-uris\"\n                \"extension\": [\n                    {\n                        \"url\": \"authorize\",\n                        \"valueUri\": \"https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/auth\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"url\": \"token\",\n                        \"valueUri\": \"https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/token\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"url\": \"register\",\n                        \"valueUri\": \"https://localhost:8443/auth/realms/test/clients-registrations/openid-connect\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ],\n        …\n```\n\nSMART on FHIR applications should use the `.well-known/smart-configuration` endpoint to determine the OAuth URLs to use for authorization,\nbut the entries in the Capability Statement are needed for backwards compatibility.\n\n### 5.3.3 SMART App Launch\nTo support [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch), the IBM FHIR Server can be used with a SMART-enabled authorization server. For an example of a SMART-enabled Authorization Server, see the [Alvearie Keycloak extensions for FHIR](https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir).\n\nThe OAuth configuration described in the previous sections will restrict API access to clients with a valid access token.\nHowever, SMART defines additional access controls via OAuth 2.0 scopes and context parameters.\n\nTo enforce authorization policy on the server, drop the `fhir-smart` module into the server's userlib directory.\n\nThis component uses the IBM FHIR Server's PersistenceInterceptor feature to automatically scope searches to the compartments for which the user has access (as indicated by a special `patient_id` claim in the access token).\n\nAdditionally, before returning resources to the client, the `fhir-smart` component performs authorization policy enforcement based on the list of SMART scopes included in the token's `scope` claim and the list of patient compartments in the `patient_id` claim.\n\nWhen the HTTP header `Prefer: return=minimal` is specified on a search or history request, only minimal resource metadata is retrieved. In those cases, either `user` or `system` SMART scopes must be used, since the resource data necessary to enforce access via `patient` SMART scopes is not available.\n\nFor an example of using the IBM FHIR Server together with a SMART-enabled Keycloak authorization server, please see the data-access pattern at https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-patterns/tree/main/data-access.\n\n## 5.4 Custom HTTP Headers\nIBM FHIR Server Supports the following custom HTTP Headers:\n\n| Header Name      | Description                |\n|------------------|----------------------------|\n|`X-FHIR-TENANT-ID`|Specifies which tenant config should be used for the request. Default is `default`. The header name can be overridden via config property `fhirServer/core/tenantIdHeaderName`.|\n|`X-FHIR-DSID`|Specifies which datastore config should be used for the request. Default is `default`. The header name can be overridden via config property `fhirServer/core/dataSourceIdHeaderName`.|\n|`X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL`|The original (user-facing) request URL; used for constructing absolute URLs within the server response. Only enabled when explicitly configured in the default fhir-server-config.json. If either the config property or the header itself is missing, the server will use the actual request URL. The header name can be overridden via config property `fhirServer/core/originalRequestUriHeaderName`. Note that `fhirServer/core/externalBaseUrl` overrides the `X-FHIR-FORWARDED-URL` and is used to construct the absolute URL. Also note that the base URL's value must not include a path segment that matches any FHIR resource type name (case-sensitive). For example, \"https://example.com\" or \"https://example.com/my/patient/api\" are fine, but \"https://example.com/my/Patient/api\" is not.|\n|`X-FHIR-FORCE-UPDATE`|By default, when the server receives an update request, it performs a resource comparison and only performs the update if the contents of the resource have changed. Set this header to true to skip that check and perform a normal update (i.e. create a new version for this resource id).|\n\n# 6 Related topics\nFor more information about topics related to configuring a FHIR server, see the following documentation:\n*   [Java 11 Keytool documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/keytool.html)\n*   [WebSphere Liberty documentation: Configuring your web application and server for client certificate authentication](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_sec_clientcert.html)\n*   [Java EE 7 Tutorial, Chapter 50](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/security-advanced002.htm#GLIEN)\n*   [WebSphere Liberty documentation: Defining an OAuth Service Provider](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_oauth_defining.html)\n*   [WebSphere Liberty documentation: Configuring an Open ID Connect Client in liberty](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_config_oidc_rp.html)\n\n<hr/>\n\n- <b name=\"f1\">1</b>\n\n    The fhir-server-config.json file contains configuration information associated with the FHIR server. The global configuration is located in `WLP_HOME/wlp/usr/servers/fhir-server/config/default/fhir-server-config.json`, with tenant-specific configuration contained in `config/TENANT_ID/fhir-server-config.json`. [↩](#a1)\n\n- <b name=\"f2\">2</b>\n\n    When running database-related commands (e.g. createDB.sh, liquibase, etc.) you'll need to make sure that the Db2-related executables are in your PATH, and also that you are logged in as a user that has the necessary authority to create the database and/or create the schema.  Normally, if you log in as the Db2 administrative user (typically \"db2inst1\") then you should be fine. [↩](#a2)\n\n- <b id=\"f3\">3</b>\n\n    The names of these request headers are configurable within the FHIR server's fhir-server-config.json file.

The value typically includes the resource type and the resource identifier, and could be an absolute or relative URL. Examples:  `https://fhirserver1:9443/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/12345`, `Patient/12345`, etc.  Requiring relative URLs to include a valid resource type can be configured via the `fhirServer/core/checkReferenceTypes` config property. For more information, see [Section 5.1 Configuration properties reference](#51-configuration-properties-reference). [↩](#a5)\n\n- <b id=\"f6\">6</b>\n\n    A local reference is a reference used within a request bundle that refers to another resource within the same request bundle and is meaningful only within that request bundle. A local reference starts with `urn:`. [↩](#a6)\n\n- <b id=\"f7\">7</b>\n\n    Keystore and truststore files have the same basic structure. They both provide a secure means for storing certificates. Typically, we think of a keystore as a file that contains certificates that consist of a private/public key pair, whereas a truststore contains certificates that consist of a public key or trusted certificates. [↩](#a7)\n\n- <b id=\"f8\">8</b>\n\n    While the instructions here show examples of creating self-signed certificates, in reality the FHIR Server deployer will likely need to use certificates that have been signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) such as Verisign, etc. [↩](#a8)\n\n- <b id=\"f9\">9</b>\n\n    The _keytool_ command is provided as part of the Java 11 JRE.  The command can be found in $JAVA_HOME/jre/bin. [↩](#a9)\n\n- <b id=\"f10\">10</b> These instructions assume the use of a basic user registry in the server.xml file.  If you are instead using an LDAP registry, then the entire DN associated with the client certificate must match the DN of a user in the LDAP registry.
