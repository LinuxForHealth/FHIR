After all, if there will be no need to use the search index information, there’s no need to store it. For example, if you know that due to the way in which a particular tenant’s applications use the FHIR REST API that those applications will never need to search Patients by birthdate, then there would be no need to store search index information for the ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"birthdate")," attribute in ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Patient")," resources. And consequently, you could filter out the ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"birthdate")," search parameter for the ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Patient")," resource type and not lose any needed functionality, but yet save a little bit of storage capacity in your datastore."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"The search parameter filtering feature is supported through a set of inclusion rules specified via the ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"fhirServer/searchParameterFilter")," configuration property.
