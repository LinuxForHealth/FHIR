This item SHOULD be populated unless the information is available from context (e.g. the language of the value set is presumed to be the predominant language in the place the value set was created).The description is not intended to describe the semantics of the Value Set - there are no intrinsic semantics separate from the codes contained in its expansion. The description should capture its intended use, which is needed for ensuring integrity for its use in models across future changes. A description should be provided unless the value set is a contained resource (e.g. an anonymous value set in a profile). Most registries will require a description.",
