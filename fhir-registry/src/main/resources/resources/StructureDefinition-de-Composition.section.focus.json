If not focus is specified, the focus is assumed to be focus of the parent section, or, for a section in the Composition itself, the subject of the composition. Sections with a focus SHALL only include resources where the logical subject (patient, subject, focus, etc.) matches the section focus, or the resources have no logical subject (few resources).",

For some kind of documents, some sections actually contain data about related entities. Typical examples are  a section in a newborn discharge summary concerning the mother, or family history documents, with a section about each family member, though there are many other examples.",
