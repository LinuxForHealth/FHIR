If the derivation kind is 'specialization' then this is the master definition for a type, and there is always one of these (a data type, an extension, a resource, including abstract ones). Otherwise the structure definition is a constraint on the stated type (and in this case, the type cannot be an abstract type).  References are URLs that are relative to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition e.g. \"string\" is a reference to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/string. Absolute URLs are only allowed in logical models.",
                "comment": "Note that in the case of constraints, the type could be determined by chasing through the baseDefinition references until a concrete structure (derivation = specialization) is reached, or by looking at the path of the first element in the snapshot - if present - but providing the type directly makes for simpler tooling and indexing. \n\nThe type must match the elements defined in the differential and the snapshot. For all FHIR defined types, the path name of the element will start with the type name. For logical models, where the type is a URL, the type name SHOULD start with the tail of the type URL where required.",
