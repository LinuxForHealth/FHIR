Multiple instances may share the same URL if they have a distinct version.\n\nThe determination of when to create a new version of a resource (same url, new version) vs. defining a new artifact is up to the author.  Considerations for making this decision are found in [Technical and Business Versions](resource.html#versions). \n\nIn some cases, the resource can no longer be found at the stated url, but the url itself cannot change. Implementations can use the [meta.source](resource.html#meta) element to indicate where the current master source of the resource can be found.",
