Note that since [FHIR resources do not need to be served through the FHIR API](references.html), the fullURL might be a URN or an absolute URL that does not end with the logical id of the resource (Resource.id). However, but if the fullUrl does look like a RESTful server URL (e.g. meets the [regex](references.html#regex), then the 'id' portion of the fullUrl SHALL end with the Resource.id.\n\nNote that the fullUrl is not the same as the canonical URL - it's an absolute url for an endpoint serving the resource (these will happen to have the same value on the canonical server for the resource with the canonical URL).",
