Although partial dates are allowed, an adult patient might not be able to recall the year a childhood immunization was given. An exact date is always preferable, but the use of the String data type is acceptable when an exact date is not known. A small number of vaccines (e.g. live oral typhoid vaccine) are given as a series of patient self-administered dose over a span of time. In cases like this, often, only the first dose (typically a provider supervised dose) is recorded with the occurrence indicating the date/time of the first dose.",
