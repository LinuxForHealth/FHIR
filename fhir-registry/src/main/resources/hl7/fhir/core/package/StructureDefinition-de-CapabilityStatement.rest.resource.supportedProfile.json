For a server, \"supported by the system\" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](profiling.html#profile-uses).",
                "comment": "Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).",
