    "description": "This operation allows a client to find an identified list for a particular function by its function. The operation takes two parameters, the identity of a patient, and the name of a functional list.     The list of defined functional lists can be found at [Current Resource Lists](lifecycle.html#lists). Applications are not required to support all the lists, and may define additional lists of their own.   If the system is able to locate a list that serves the identified purpose, it returns it as the body of the response with a 200 OK status. If the resource cannot be located, the server returns a 404 not found (optionally with an OperationOutcome resource)",
