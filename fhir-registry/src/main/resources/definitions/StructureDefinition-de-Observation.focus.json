For example, fetus observations in a mother's record.  The focus of an observation could also be an existing condition,  an intervention, the subject's diet,  another observation of the subject,  or a body structure such as tumor or implanted device.   An example use case would be using the Observation resource to capture whether the mother is trained to change her child's tracheostomy tube. In this example, the child is the patient of record and the mother is the focus.",
                "comment": "Typically, an observation is made about the subject - a patient, or group of patients, location, or device - and the distinction between the subject and what is directly measured for an observation is specified in the observation code itself ( e.g., \"Blood Glucose\") and does not need to be represented separately using this element.  Use `specimen` if a reference to a specimen is required.  If a code is required instead of a resource use either  `bodysite` for bodysites or the standard extension [focusCode](extension-observation-focuscode.html).",
