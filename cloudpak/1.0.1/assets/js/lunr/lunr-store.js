        "excerpt":"The following sections provide instructions about installing IBM FHIR Server on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The instructions are based on using the OpenShift Container Platform web console and oc command line utility. When deploying in an air-gapped environment see Air Gap Installation. Overview IBM FHIR Server is an operator-based release and uses custom resources to define your IBM FHIR Server configurations. The IBM FHIR Server operator uses the custom resources to deploy and manage the entire lifecycle of your IBM FHIR Server instances. Custom resources are presented as YAML configuration documents that define instances of the IBMFHIRServer custom resource type. Installing IBM FHIR Server has two phases:   Install the IBM FHIR Server operator: this will deploy the operator that will install and manage your IBM FHIR Server instances.  Install one or more instances of IBM FHIR Server by using the operator.Before you begin   Ensure you have set up your environment , including setting up your OpenShift Container Platform.  Obtain the connection details for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster from your administrator.Create a project (namespace) Create a namespace into which the IBM FHIR Server instance will be installed by creating a project.When you create a project, a namespace with the same name is also created. Ensure you use a namespace that is dedicated to a single instance of IBM FHIR Server. A single namespace per instance also allows for finer control of user accesses. Important: Do not use any of the default or system namespaces to install an instance of IBM FHIR Server (some examples of these are: default, kube-system, kube-public, and openshift-operators). Add the IBM FHIR Server operator to the catalog Before you can install the IBM FHIR Server operator and use it to create instances of IBM FHIR Server, you must have the IBM Operator Catalog available in your cluster. If you have other IBM products installed in your cluster, then you already have the IBM Operator Catalog available, and you can continue installing the IBM FHIR Server operator. If you are installing IBM FHIR Server as the first IBM product in your cluster, complete the following steps. To make the IBM FHIR Server operator available in the OpenShift OperatorHub catalog, create the following YAML files and apply them as  follows. To add the IBM Operator Catalog:       Create a file for the IBM Operator Catalog source with the following content, and save as IBMCatalogSource.yaml:     apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1kind: CatalogSourcemetadata:   name: ibm-operator-catalog   namespace: openshift-marketplacespec:   displayName: \"IBM Operator Catalog\"   publisher: IBM   sourceType: grpc   image: docker.io/ibmcom/ibm-operator-catalog   updateStrategy:     registryPoll:       interval: 45m        Log in to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a cluster administrator by using the oc CLI.      Apply the source by using the following command:     oc apply -f IBMCatalogSource.yaml   The IBM Operator Catalog source is added to the OperatorHub catalog, making the IBM FHIR Server operator available to install. Install Operator Install the Operator using the following method:       Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console                   Log into the OpenShift Container Platform web console using your login credentials.                     Navigate to OperatorHub and click on the IBM FHIR Server tile.                     Click Install.             ","categories": ["installing"],

If you intend to use CLI commands, ensure you have the following installed:   IBM Cloud Pak CLI (cloudctl)  Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc)Creating an instance Complete the following steps to create an instance of IBM FHIR Server. 1. Define IBM FHIR Server configuration Create Secret resource containing IBM FHIR Server configuration.   Define values for the following secret keys:      IBM_FHIR_SCHEMA_TOOL_INPUT     The value must be set to the contents of the configuration file for IBM FHIR Server Schema Tool.     See IBM FHIR Server Schema Tool for how to create a configuration file.     Put the contents of the configuration file in a file named persistence.json.         IBM_FHIR_SERVER_CONFIG     The value must be set to the contents of the fhir-server-config.json configuration file for IBM FHIR Server.     See IBM FHIR Server for how to create a fhir-server-config.json configuration file.     Put the contents of the configuration file in a file named fhir-server-config.json.         IBM_FHIR_SERVER_CERT     If using Postgres as the database, this value must be set to the public key of the intermediate CA certificate.     Put the public key of the intermediate CA certificate in a file named db.cert.     If using Db2 as the database, leave the file named db.cert empty.         IBM_FHIR_SERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD     The value must be set to the admin password to use for the IBM FHIR Server.     Put the admin password in a file named admin.txt.         IBM_FHIR_SERVER_USER_PASSWORD     The value must be set to the user password to use for the IBM FHIR Server.     Put the user password in a file named user.txt.         IBM_FHIR_SERVER_HOST     The value must be set to the contents of a configuration file for defining the host.     See Defining the host for how to define the host.     Put the contents of the configuration file in a file named host.xml.     If you do not want to define the host, leave the file named host.xml empty.

Create IBM FHIR Server instance Create an instance of IBM FHIR Server of the following methods: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console       Log into the OpenShift Container Platform web console using your login credentials.         Navigate to Installed Operators and click on IBM FHIR Server.         Click Create Instance on the IBMFHIRServer tile.         Enter a name for the instance, and enter the name of the Secret resource containing the IBM FHIR Server configuration.         Click Create.   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI   Create an IBMFHIRServer resource in the target namespace by editing the namespace and secret name in the sample file, files/fhirserver_v1beta1_ibmfhirserver.yaml, and then apply the file.  $ oc apply -f files/fhirserver_v1beta1_ibmfhirserver.yamlIBM Cloud Pak CLI   Run the apply-custom-resources action.  $ cloudctl case launch \\      --case case/ibm-fhir-server-case \\      --namespace &lt;target-namespace&gt; \\      --inventory ibmFhirServerOperator \\      --action apply-custom-resources \\      --args \"--secretName &lt;secret-name&gt;\"  &lt;target-namespace&gt; is the target namespace.  &lt;secret-name&gt; is the name of the Secret resource containing the IBM FHIR Server configuration.3. Accessing IBM FHIR Server instance   Verify the IBM FHIR Server instance is functional.  $ oc get ibmfhirservers -n &lt;target-namespace&gt;      &lt;target-namespace&gt; is the target namespace.     The READY value of “True” indicates the IBM FHIR Server instance is functional.     Connect to the IBM FHIR Server instance.  $ oc get services -n &lt;target-namespace&gt;      &lt;target-namespace&gt; is the target namespace.     To make external connections to the IBM FHIR Server instance, either port-forward or create a route to the service.     See the IBM FHIR Server User’s Guide for how to verify that it’s running properly by invoking the $healthcheck endpoint.   Scaling By default, the deployment will contain 2 replicas. Use the oc scale command to manually scale an IBM FHIR Server deployment. Defining the host It is recommended, for security purposes, to explicitly define the hosts for which the IBM FHIR Server will handle requests. For any Route resources created for the IBM FHIR Server, ensure those hosts (e.g. test-fhir-server) are represented in the configuration file. &lt;server description=\"fhir-server\"&gt;    &lt;httpEndpoint host=\"*\" httpPort=\"-1\" httpsPort=\"9443\" id=\"defaultHttpEndpoint\" onError=\"FAIL\" /&gt;    &lt;virtualHost id=\"default_host\" allowedFromEndpointRef=\"defaultHttpEndpoint\"&gt;      &lt;hostAlias&gt;*:9443&lt;/hostAlias&gt;      &lt;hostAlias&gt;test-fhir-server:443&lt;/hostAlias&gt;    &lt;/virtualHost&gt;&lt;/server&gt;Deleting an instance Delete an instance of IBM FHIR Server using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.       Log into the OpenShift Container Platform web console using your login credentials.         Navigate to Installed Operators and click on IBM FHIR Server.         Navigate to the IBMFHIRServer tab and click on the instance you want to delete.         Select Delete IBMFHIRServer from the Actions menu.   ","categories": ["installing"],

Manual license measurements are not allowed. Deploy License Service on all clusters where IBM FHIR Server is installed. The IBM FHIR Server Operator contains an integrated service for measuring the license usage at the cluster level for license evidence purposes. Overview The integrated licensing solution collects and stores the license usage information which can be used for audit purposes and for tracking license consumption in cloud environments. The solution works in the background and does not require any configuration. Only one instance of the License Service is deployed per cluster regardless of the number of Cloud Paks and containerized products that you have installed on the cluster. Deploying License Service Deploy License Service on each cluster where IBM FHIR Server is installed. License Service can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster. For more information about License Service, how to install and use it, see the License Service documentation. Validating if License Service is deployed on the cluster To ensure license reporting continuity for license compliance purposes make sure that License Service is successfully deployed. It is recommended to periodically verify whether it is active. To validate whether License Service is deployed and running on the cluster, you can, for example, log into the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and run the following command: $ oc get pods --all-namespaces | grep ibm-licensing | grep -v operatorThe following response is a confirmation of successful deployment: 1/1     RunningArchiving license usage data Remember to archive the license usage evidence before you decommission the cluster where IBM FHIR Server was deployed.
