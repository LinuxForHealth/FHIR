Covariance is symmetric so cov(x,y)\u003dcov(y,x). The covariance is usefull when looking at the variance of the sum of the 2 random variables since: var(x+y) \u003d var(x) +var(y) +2cov(x,y) the covariance cov(x,y) is used to obtain the coefficient of correlation cor(x,y) by normalizing (dividing) cov(x,y) but the product of the standard deviations of x and y.\u003c/td\u003e\n        \n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n\n\n\n        \u003ctr\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd style\u003d\"white-space:nowrap\"\u003epredictedRisk\n            \n            \u003ca name\u003d\"statistic-type-predictedRisk\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\n          \n          \u003c/td\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd\u003ePredicted Risk\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd\u003eA special use case where the proportion is derived from a formula rather than derived from summary evidence.\u003c/td\u003e\n        \n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n\n\n\n        \u003ctr\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd style\u003d\"white-space:nowrap\"\u003edescriptive\n            \n            \u003ca name\u003d\"statistic-type-descriptive\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\n          \n          \u003c/td\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd\u003eDescriptive\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd\u003eDescriptive measure reported as narrative.\u003c/td\u003e\n        \n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n\n\n\n        \u003ctr\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd style\u003d\"white-space:nowrap\"\u003eC93150\n            \n            \u003ca name\u003d\"statistic-type-C93150\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\n          \n          \u003c/td\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd\u003eHazard Ratio\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd\u003eA measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time.

A risk ratio of one means there is no difference between two groups in terms of their risk of cancer, based on whether or not they were exposed to a certain substance or factor, or how they responded to two treatments being compared. A risk ratio of greater than one or of less than one usually means that being exposed to a certain substance or factor either increases (risk ratio greater than one) or decreases (risk ratio less than one) the risk of cancer, or that the treatments being compared do not have the same effects.\u003c/td\u003e\n        \n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n\n\n\n        \u003ctr\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd style\u003d\"white-space:nowrap\"\u003e0000424\n            \n            \u003ca name\u003d\"statistic-type-0000424\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\n          \n          \u003c/td\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd\u003eRisk Difference\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n          \u003ctd\u003eDifference between the observed risks (proportions of individuals with the outcome of interest) in the two groups.
